**Version:** 0.2
**Date:** 2025-06-11
**Related Documents:** `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_WORKFLOW.md`

## 1. Current Task & Focus

**Primary Goal:** Update the Memory Bank documentation to accurately reflect the planned **Multi-Project Staff Automation System**. This involves integrating insights from `docs/MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md` and `docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_WORKFLOW.md` into the core Memory Bank files.

**Secondary Goal (Deferred):** Continue implementation of features like the Equipment Modification System UI and remaining visual polish, once documentation is aligned.

**Immediate Steps (Current Documentation Task):**
1.  **Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`:** Reflect new architecture for multi-project management, staff automation, and animation. (Completed)
2.  **Update `memory-bank/techContext.md`:** Detail technical implications, state management considerations, and new service patterns. (Completed)
3.  **Update `memory-bank/productContext.md`:** Incorporate multi-project vision into core gameplay and UX goals. (Completed)
4.  **Update `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`:** Add multi-project system to key planned features. (Completed)
5.  **Review and Refine `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (This Document):** Ensure it accurately captures the current documentation focus and next steps. (Ongoing)
6.  **Review and Refine `memory-bank/progress.md`:** Align its "What's Left to Build" and "Evolution" sections with the new system and documentation updates.
7.  Address any emergent code issues (e.g., TypeScript errors in `src/components/AnimatedProjectCard.tsx`) after documentation alignment.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Memory Bank Documentation Update (Ongoing):**
    *   Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (Version 0.2) with architectural details of the multi-project automation system.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` (Version 0.2) with technical considerations for the new system.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/productContext.md` (Version 0.2) to reflect the product vision including multi-project management.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (Version 0.2) to include multi-project automation as a key planned feature.
*   **Previous Development (Pre-Documentation Task):**
    *   Initialized core Memory Bank files.
    *   Analyzed existing documentation and codebase.
    *   Implemented various data structure modifications for mood, condition, and equipment mods.
    *   Added new historical equipment data.
    *   Partially implemented "Living Studio" animations (Recording, Mixing, Artist Moods, Day/Night Cycle).
    *   Implemented initial logic for Equipment Modification System (research start/completion).
    *   Created placeholders for new minigames.
    *   Integrated Vercel Speed Insights.
    *   Fixed audio playback `NotAllowedError`.
    *   Fixed i18n configuration.
    *   Fixed project completion flow.
    *   Made UI/UX improvements (static background, emoji changes).
    *   **Created comprehensive `docs/MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`**.

## 3. Next Immediate Actions (Post-Documentation Update)

1.  **Address TypeScript Errors:** Fix errors in `src/components/AnimatedProjectCard.tsx` and any other outstanding issues.
2.  **Begin Phase 1 of Multi-Project Staff Automation System:** As per `docs/MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`:
    *   **Data Structure Refactoring:** Update `GameState` to support multiple active projects, create `ProjectManager` service, implement project capacity system, update save/load.
    *   **Basic Multi-Project UI:** Design and implement dashboard layout, project card components, project selection/switching.
3.  **Equipment Modification System UI Completion:**
    *   Fully implement `ResearchModal.tsx`.
    *   Implement UI for applying mods and displaying modified gear.
4.  **Visual Polish Completion:**
    *   Implement UI for Equipment Status Animations.
    *   Integrate active project animations for auto-working staff.

## 4. Active Considerations & Potential Challenges

*   **Documentation Accuracy:** Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the comprehensive plans in `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`.
*   **Complexity of Multi-Project System:** The planned system is large and will touch many parts of the codebase. Phased implementation and thorough testing (as outlined in the plan) are critical.
*   **State Management Scalability:** The current custom hook/context approach needs to be robust enough for `EnhancedGameState` or alternatives explored.
*   **UI/UX for Multi-Project View:** Designing an intuitive and clear interface for managing multiple projects and automation settings is a significant challenge.
*   **Performance:** Maintaining performance with multiple concurrent projects, automated staff actions, and animations will require ongoing optimization.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (from User Instructions & Plans)

*   **Emoji-Stylized Design:** Consistent application.
*   **Historical Detail:** For equipment and game progression.
*   **Clean Code:** Well-commented TypeScript.
*   **Completeness:** Full implementations.
*   **Iterative Documentation:** Core to Cline's workflow.
*   **Phased Implementation:** As detailed in `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights

*   The project is undertaking a significant expansion with the multi-project automation system.
*   Detailed planning (as seen in `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`) is crucial for managing such complexity.
*   Maintaining accurate and up-to-date Memory Bank documentation is paramount for "Cline" to effectively contribute to this evolving project.
