*   **Complexity of Multi-Project System:** The planned system is large and will touch many parts of the codebase. Phased implementation and thorough testing (as outlined in the plan) are critical.
*   **State Management Scalability:** The current custom hook/context approach needs to be robust enough for `EnhancedGameState` or alternatives explored.
*   **UI/UX for Multi-Project View:** Designing an intuitive and clear interface for managing multiple projects and automation settings is an ongoing challenge (recent layout changes are a step in this direction).
*   **Performance:** Maintaining performance with multiple concurrent projects, automated staff actions, and animations will require ongoing optimization.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (from User Instructions & Plans)

*   **Emoji-Stylized Design:** Consistent application.
*   **Historical Detail:** For equipment and game progression.
*   **Clean Code:** Well-commented TypeScript.
*   **Completeness:** Full implementations.
*   **Iterative Documentation:** Core to Cline's workflow, including `memory-bank` and specified `docs/` files.
*   **Phased Implementation:** As detailed in `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`.
*   **Responsive Layouts:** Use of Tailwind CSS for adaptive UI (reinforced by recent layout work).

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights

*   The project is undertaking a significant expansion with the multi-project automation system.
*   Detailed planning (as seen in `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`) is crucial for managing such complexity.
*   Maintaining accurate and up-to-date Memory Bank documentation (and other specified project docs) is paramount for "Cline" to effectively contribute to this evolving project.
*   Robust flexbox hierarchies are essential for creating adaptive UIs that behave well in both fullscreen and windowed modes.
