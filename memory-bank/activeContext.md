**Date:** 2025-06-11
**Related Documents:** `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`

## 1. Current Task & Focus

**Primary Goal:** Enrich the player experience in "Recording Studio Tycoon" by adding visual flair (animations) and deeper gameplay mechanics (historical equipment, equipment mods), while respecting the existing emoji-stylized design.

**Immediate Steps:**
1.  **Complete Memory Bank Setup:** Ensure all core Memory Bank files are initialized. (Ongoing)
2.  **Analyze Existing Documentation & Code:**
    *   Thoroughly analyze game documentation and existing code structure. The user specified a GitHub URL: `https://github.com/sp80808/recording-studio-tycoon/tree/feature/polished-pre-overhaul/docs`. I will need to assess if the local `docs/` directory is sufficient or if I need to request specific content from this URL if direct access is not possible.
    *   Pay close attention to data structures for equipment and artists.
    *   Understand how the game loop and UI are managed.
3.  **State Confidence Score:** Provide a confidence level (0-10) for integrating new features.
4.  **Develop Implementation Plan:** Create a Markdown-formatted plan detailing file modifications and new data structures for equipment mods and animations.
5.  **Implement Feature Set 1: Living Studio (Visuals & Animation)**
    *   Recording animation (tape machine Î¶¥).
    *   Mixing animation (mixing console üéõÔ∏è).
    *   Artist mood animations (‚ú® or üéµ).
    *   Equipment status animations (üí® or ‚ö†Ô∏è).
    *   Day/Night cycle background transition.
6.  **Implement Feature Set 2: Historical Evolution & Equipment Mods**
    *   New 1960s equipment: EMT 140 Plate Reverb, Fairchild 670 compressor.
    *   New 1070s equipment: SSL 4000 series console, Lexicon 224 digital reverb.
    *   Equipment Modification System:
        *   "Research" action for engineers.
        *   Mods for UREI 1176 compressor (üéõÔ∏è) -> "Rev A / Blue Stripe".
        *   UI indication for modified gear.
7.  **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation files with changes made, especially for new systems like equipment mods.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   Initialized core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   Completed analysis of existing documentation and relevant codebase sections (data structures, types).
*   Stated Confidence Score: 9/10.
*   Developed and presented the Implementation Plan.
*   **Data Structure Modifications (Completed):**
    *   Added `mood: number` to `Artist` interface in `src/types/charts.ts`.
    *   Added default `mood: 70` to artists in `src/data/artistsData.ts`.
    *   Added `condition: number` to `Equipment` interface in `src/types/game.ts`.
    *   Ensured new equipment in `src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx` (purchaseEquipment) initializes with `condition: 100`.
    *   Added `condition: 100` to all existing equipment definitions in `src/data/eraEquipment.ts`.
    *   Defined `EquipmentMod` interface and added `appliedModId?: string | null` to `Equipment` interface in `src/types/game.ts`.
    *   Created `src/data/equipmentMods.ts` with the "UREI 1176 Rev A / Blue Stripe" mod.
*   **New Historical Equipment (Added to `src/data/eraEquipment.ts`):**
    *   UREI 1176 Compressor (base item for modding)
    *   EMT 140 Plate Reverb
    *   Fairchild 670 Compressor
    *   SSL 4000 Series Console
    *   Lexicon 224 Digital Reverb (Early 1970s version)
*   Fixed pre-existing TypeScript errors in `src/pages/Index.tsx` and `src/components/minigames/MinigameManager.tsx`.
*   **Feature Set 1: Living Studio (Visuals & Animation) - Partially Implemented:**
    *   Recording Animation (Î¶¥): Added to `ActiveProject.tsx` and `EnhancedAnimationStyles.tsx`.
    *   Mixing Animation (üéõÔ∏è): Added to `ActiveProject.tsx` and `EnhancedAnimationStyles.tsx`.
    *   Artist Moods (‚ú®/üéµ): `MoodIndicator.tsx` component created, animation style added, and integrated into `BandManagement.tsx` for staff members.
    *   Equipment Status (üí®/‚ö†Ô∏è): CSS animations created in `EnhancedAnimationStyles.tsx`. UI integration deferred.
    *   Day/Night Cycle: Implemented in `GameLayout.tsx` and `Index.tsx`.
*   **Equipment Modification System - Initial Logic:**
    *   `getModifiedEquipment` helper function created in `src/utils/equipmentUtils.ts`.
    *   `researchedMods` field added to `GameState` and initialized.
    *   `StaffMember` interface updated for research tracking.
    *   `startResearchMod` function added to `useStaffManagement.tsx` and plumbed through `useGameLogic` and `Index.tsx` to `RightPanel.tsx`.
    *   Research completion logic added to `advanceDay` in `useGameActions.tsx`.
    *   Placeholder `ResearchModal.tsx` created and integrated into `RightPanel.tsx`.
*   **New Minigames (Placeholders and Basic Integration):**
    *   `VocalTuningGame.tsx` created with basic structure.
    *   `LiveRecordingGame.tsx` created with basic structure.
    *   Both added to `MinigameType` and `MinigameManager.tsx` switch statement.
    *   Basic trigger logic for both added to `minigameUtils.ts`.
    *   Fixed various TS errors that arose during these additions.
*   **Vercel Speed Insights:** Added `<SpeedInsights />` component to `src/main.tsx`.

## 3. Next Immediate Actions

1.  Fully implement the UI and logic within `ResearchModal.tsx` for selecting equipment and mods.
2.  Implement UI for applying researched mods to owned equipment (e.g., in an equipment detail view for owned items).
3.  Implement display of modified equipment stats and name in relevant UI locations.
4.  Implement UI for **Equipment Status Animations** (üí®/‚ö†Ô∏è) once an owned equipment display location is clear or created.
5.  Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`) and other relevant documentation as these UI features are implemented.

## 4. Active Considerations & Potential Challenges

*   **External URL Access:** I cannot directly access external URLs. The analysis of documentation from the GitHub link will depend on the content available in the local workspace or information provided by the user.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating new animation and equipment modification systems into an existing codebase requires careful planning to ensure compatibility and maintainability.
*   **Data Structure Design:** Designing flexible and extensible data structures for equipment mods is crucial.
*   **Animation Performance:** Ensuring animations are smooth and don't degrade performance, especially with multiple animated elements.
*   **UI Clarity:** The UI must clearly communicate new information (e.g., modified equipment, research progress) without cluttering the existing design.
*   **Respecting Existing Code:** Adhering to established coding patterns and quality standards is paramount.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (from User Instructions)

*   **Emoji-Stylized Design:** All visual additions must respect this.
*   **Historical Detail:** New equipment should be historically significant.
*   **Clean Code:** Well-commented JavaScript/TypeScript.
*   **Completeness:** Provide full, complete functions and data object updates. No lazy omissions.
*   **Iterative Documentation:** Update Memory Bank and other relevant docs as new systems are added.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (Initial)

*   The project has a solid foundation with existing documentation and a structured codebase (inferred from file list and `techContext.md`).
*   The use of React and TypeScript provides a modern development environment.
*   The emphasis on Memory Bank documentation by "Cline" (me) is a core part of the workflow.
