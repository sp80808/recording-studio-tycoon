**Related Documents:** `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`

## 1. Current Task & Focus

**Primary Goal:** Enrich the player experience in "Recording Studio Tycoon" by adding visual flair (animations) and deeper gameplay mechanics (historical equipment, equipment mods), while respecting the existing emoji-stylized design.

**Immediate Steps:**
1.  **Complete Memory Bank Setup:** Ensure all core Memory Bank files are initialized. (Ongoing)
2.  **Analyze Existing Documentation & Code:**
    *   Thoroughly analyze game documentation and existing code structure. The user specified a GitHub URL: `https://github.com/sp80808/recording-studio-tycoon/tree/feature/polished-pre-overhaul/docs`. I will need to assess if the local `docs/` directory is sufficient or if I need to request specific content from this URL if direct access is not possible.
    *   Pay close attention to data structures for equipment and artists.
    *   Understand how the game loop and UI are managed.
3.  **State Confidence Score:** Provide a confidence level (0-10) for integrating new features.
4.  **Develop Implementation Plan:** Create a Markdown-formatted plan detailing file modifications and new data structures for equipment mods and animations.
5.  **Implement Feature Set 1: Living Studio (Visuals & Animation)**
    *   Recording animation (tape machine 릴).
    *   Mixing animation (mixing console 🎛️).
    *   Artist mood animations (✨ or 🎵).
    *   Equipment status animations (💨 or ⚠️).
    *   Day/Night cycle background transition.
6.  **Implement Feature Set 2: Historical Evolution & Equipment Mods**
    *   New 1960s equipment: EMT 140 Plate Reverb, Fairchild 670 compressor.
    *   New 1070s equipment: SSL 4000 series console, Lexicon 224 digital reverb.
    *   Equipment Modification System:
        *   "Research" action for engineers.
        *   Mods for UREI 1176 compressor (🎛️) -> "Rev A / Blue Stripe".
        *   UI indication for modified gear.
7.  **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation files with changes made, especially for new systems like equipment mods.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   Initialized core Memory Bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.

## 3. Next Immediate Actions

1.  Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
2.  Address the analysis of documentation from the provided GitHub link. This likely involves listing files in the local `docs/` directory and comparing its apparent scope to the task's requirements.
3.  Proceed with the analysis, confidence score, and implementation plan as outlined by the user.

## 4. Active Considerations & Potential Challenges

*   **External URL Access:** I cannot directly access external URLs. The analysis of documentation from the GitHub link will depend on the content available in the local workspace or information provided by the user.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating new animation and equipment modification systems into an existing codebase requires careful planning to ensure compatibility and maintainability.
*   **Data Structure Design:** Designing flexible and extensible data structures for equipment mods is crucial.
*   **Animation Performance:** Ensuring animations are smooth and don't degrade performance, especially with multiple animated elements.
*   **UI Clarity:** The UI must clearly communicate new information (e.g., modified equipment, research progress) without cluttering the existing design.
*   **Respecting Existing Code:** Adhering to established coding patterns and quality standards is paramount.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (from User Instructions)

*   **Emoji-Stylized Design:** All visual additions must respect this.
*   **Historical Detail:** New equipment should be historically significant.
*   **Clean Code:** Well-commented JavaScript/TypeScript.
*   **Completeness:** Provide full, complete functions and data object updates. No lazy omissions.
*   **Iterative Documentation:** Update Memory Bank and other relevant docs as new systems are added.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (Initial)

*   The project has a solid foundation with existing documentation and a structured codebase (inferred from file list and `techContext.md`).
*   The use of React and TypeScript provides a modern development environment.
*   The emphasis on Memory Bank documentation by "Cline" (me) is a core part of the workflow.
