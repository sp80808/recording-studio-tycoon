## 2. What Works (Implemented Systems)

*   ‚úÖ **Foundational Game Structure**: React, TypeScript, Vite with modern tooling
*   ‚úÖ **Core Single-Project Management**: Artists, equipment, game loop, UI, eras, staff, minigames
*   ‚úÖ **Multi-Project Infrastructure**: Complete backend system for managing 2-5 concurrent projects
*   ‚úÖ **Automatic Progression System**: Smart unlocking of multi-project features based on:
    - Player level (Level 3+ for basic multi-project)
    - Staff count (2+ staff for dual projects)
    - Project completion history (3+ completed projects)
*   ‚úÖ **Staff Automation Engine**: Intelligent staff assignment with priority-based allocation
*   ‚úÖ **Project Capacity Management**: Dynamic calculation of max concurrent projects (2-5 based on progression)
*   ‚úÖ **Progressive UI System**: Automatically switches between single-project and multi-project interfaces
*   ‚úÖ **Automation Modes**: Off, Basic, Smart, Advanced with different optimization strategies
*   ‚úÖ **Project Prioritization**: Deadline, profit, reputation, and balanced priority modes
*   ‚úÖ **Animation State Management**: Foundation for project and staff activity animations
*   ‚úÖ **Living Studio Animations**: Recording, Mixing, Artist Moods, Day/Night Cycle (from previous work)
*   ‚úÖ **Equipment Modification System**: Research logic foundation implemented
*   ‚úÖ **Various Enhancements**: Bug fixes, UI improvements, Vercel integration, audio fixes

## 3. What's Left to Build (Post-Documentation Update)

**Primary Focus: Multi-Project Staff Automation System (Phase 1 as per `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`)**
*   **Data Structure Refactoring:**
    *   [ ] Update `GameState` to `EnhancedGameState` (support multiple active projects, automation settings, animation states).
    *   [ ] Create `ProjectManagerService.ts` for project coordination.
    *   [ ] Implement project capacity calculation system.
    *   [ ] Update save/load system for multi-project state.
    *   [ ] Create project priority and scheduling system (basic).
*   **Basic Multi-Project UI:**
    *   [ ] Design and implement multi-project dashboard layout (`MultiProjectDashboard.tsx`).
    *   [ ] Create individual project card components (`ProjectCard.tsx` / `AnimatedProjectCard.tsx` - needs TS error fix).
    *   [ ] Implement project selection and switching logic.
    *   [ ] Add basic project status indicators on cards.
    *   [ ] Create project creation flow for multiple projects.

**Secondary Focus (Features from previous iteration, to be integrated with/after Multi-Project Phase 1):**
*   **Equipment Modification System (UI & Full Logic):**
    *   [ ] Fully implement `ResearchModal.tsx` (equipment/mod selection, engineer skill checks).
    *   [ ] UI indication for modified gear (displaying modded name/stats, visual badge).
    *   [ ] Logic for applying mods (player action to select researched mod and apply to owned equipment).
    *   [ ] UI for applying mods.
*   **Living Studio (Visuals & Animation) Completion:**
    *   [ ] Equipment Status Animations (üí® or ‚ö†Ô∏è) - UI integration once owned equipment display is clear.
    *   [ ] Integrate active project animations (üé§) to appear when staff members are auto-working on projects (part of Multi-Project System's animation goals).

**General Tasks:**
*   [X] Updating Memory Bank to reflect Multi-Project Automation System. (Nearly complete)
*   [ ] Address TypeScript errors in `src/components/AnimatedProjectCard.tsx`.
*   [ ] Continue iterative development and testing as per the 8-week plan in `MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **TypeScript Errors:** Errors present in `src/components/AnimatedProjectCard.tsx` need to be addressed.
*   **Complexity of New System:** The multi-project automation system is a large undertaking. Careful, phased implementation is key.
*   **State Management Scalability:** Needs ongoing assessment as `EnhancedGameState` is implemented.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

*   **Initial Decision (2025-06-11):** Establish Memory Bank.
*   **Learning (2025-06-11):** Project uses modern tech stack. Custom hooks/Context API for state.
*   **Updates (2025-06-11):** Implemented various features, fixes, and UI improvements as detailed in "Previous Code Modifications."
*   **Strategic Shift (2025-06-11):** Decision made to prioritize the **Multi-Project Staff Automation System**. A comprehensive plan (`docs/MULTI_PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PLAN.md`) was created, outlining an 8-week development cycle. This represents a major evolution of the game's scope and depth.
*   **Current Focus (2025-06-11):** Aligning all Memory Bank documentation with the new strategic direction (Multi-Project Automation) before commencing its implementation. This ensures "Cline" has the most accurate context.
