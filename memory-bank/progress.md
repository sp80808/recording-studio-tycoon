# Progress: Recording Studio Tycoon

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2025-06-11
**Related Documents:** `activeContext.md`

## 1. Current Project Status

*   **Phase:** Initial feature enhancement phase.
*   **Overall Completion:** Low. Data structures updated, new equipment data added. Logic implementation pending.
*   **Memory Bank:** Core files initialized. `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` being updated with recent progress.
*   **Initial Code Modifications (Completed):**
    *   TypeScript definitions for `Artist` and `Equipment` updated (added `mood`, `condition`, `appliedModId`).
    *   `EquipmentMod` type defined.
    *   Default `mood` added to artist data. Default `condition` added to equipment data and on purchase.
    *   `src/data/equipmentMods.ts` created with initial mod definition.
    *   New historical equipment items (UREI 1176, EMT 140, Fairchild 670, SSL 4000, Lexicon 224 Early) added to `src/data/eraEquipment.ts`.
    *   Pre-existing TypeScript errors in `src/pages/Index.tsx` (import alias, hook destructuring, state typing) resolved.

## 2. What Works (Based on Inferred Codebase Structure & Task)

*   A foundational game structure exists (React, TypeScript, Vite).
*   Core game elements like artists, equipment, and a game loop are likely implemented to some degree (inferred from file names like `src/data/artistsData.ts`, `src/data/equipment.ts`, `src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx`).
*   A UI is in place, using an emoji-stylized design.
*   Systems for eras, projects, staff management, and minigames appear to be present.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Current Task Focus)

**Feature Set 1: Living Studio (Visuals & Animation)**
*   [ ] Recording Animation (tape machine Î¶¥)
*   [ ] Mixing Animation (mixing console üéõÔ∏è)
*   [ ] Artist Mood Animations (‚ú® or üéµ)
*   [ ] Equipment Status Animations (üí® or ‚ö†Ô∏è)
*   [ ] Day/Night Cycle background transition

**Feature Set 2: Historical Evolution & Equipment Mods**
*   [X] New 1960s Equipment (Data Added):
    *   [X] EMT 140 Plate Reverb
    *   [X] Fairchild 670 compressor
    *   [X] UREI 1176 Compressor (Base item for modding)
*   [X] New 1970s Equipment (Data Added):
    *   [X] SSL 4000 series console
    *   [X] Lexicon 224 digital reverb (Early version)
*   [ ] Equipment Modification System:
    *   [ ] "Research" action for engineers (Logic and UI).
    *   [X] Data structures for equipment mods (Types defined, `equipmentMods.ts` created).
    *   [X] UREI 1176 "Rev A / Blue Stripe" mod definition added.
    *   [ ] UI indication for modified gear.
    *   [ ] Logic for applying mods and calculating stats.

**General Tasks:**
*   [X] Thorough analysis of existing documentation and code.
*   [X] Detailed implementation plan.
*   [ ] Integration of new features into the existing codebase.
*   [ ] Updating Memory Bank and other relevant documentation as features are implemented.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **External URL Access:** Cannot directly access the GitHub URL provided for documentation. Will rely on local `docs/` content or user-provided information.
*   **Understanding Existing Systems:** A deep understanding of the current game loop, state management, and UI rendering is required before implementing new features. This is part of the "Analyze Existing Documentation & Code" step.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

*   **Initial Decision (2025-06-11):** Establish a comprehensive Memory Bank as the first step, per Cline's operational protocol. This ensures all subsequent work is well-grounded.
*   **Learning (2025-06-11):** The project uses a modern tech stack (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS), which is conducive to building complex UIs and game logic. Custom hooks and Context API are the current state management approach.
