# Progress: Recording Studio Tycoon

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2025-06-11
**Related Documents:** `activeContext.md`

## 1. Current Project Status

*   **Phase:** Initial feature enhancement phase.
*   **Overall Completion:** Low. Data structures updated, new equipment data added. Logic implementation pending.
*   **Memory Bank:** Core files initialized. `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` being updated with recent progress.
*   **Initial Code Modifications (Completed):**
    *   TypeScript definitions for `Artist` and `Equipment` updated (added `mood`, `condition`, `appliedModId`).
    *   `EquipmentMod` type defined.
    *   Default `mood` added to artist data. Default `condition` added to equipment data and on purchase.
    *   `src/data/equipmentMods.ts` created with initial mod definition.
    *   New historical equipment items (UREI 1176, EMT 140, Fairchild 670, SSL 4000, Lexicon 224 Early) added to `src/data/eraEquipment.ts`.
    *   Pre-existing TypeScript errors in `src/pages/Index.tsx`, `src/components/minigames/MinigameManager.tsx`, and `src/components/GameHeader.tsx` resolved.
*   **Feature Set 1: Living Studio (Visuals & Animation) - Implemented:**
    *   Recording Animation (Î¶¥): Added to `ActiveProject.tsx` and `EnhancedAnimationStyles.tsx`.
    *   Mixing Animation (üéõÔ∏è): Added to `ActiveProject.tsx` and `EnhancedAnimationStyles.tsx`.
    *   Artist Mood Animations (‚ú®/üéµ): `MoodIndicator.tsx` component created, animation style added, and integrated into `BandManagement.tsx` for staff members.
    *   Equipment Status (üí®/‚ö†Ô∏è): CSS animations created in `EnhancedAnimationStyles.tsx`. UI integration deferred pending identification of owned equipment display location.
    *   Day/Night Cycle: Implemented in `GameLayout.tsx` and `Index.tsx`.
*   **Equipment Modification System - Logic Foundation Implemented:**
    *   `getModifiedEquipment` helper function created in `src/utils/equipmentUtils.ts`.
    *   `researchedMods` field added to `GameState` and initialized in `useGameState.tsx`.
    *   `StaffMember` interface updated for research tracking (`status: 'Researching'`, `researchingModId`, `researchEndDay`).
    *   `startResearchMod` function (handles initiation of research) added to `useStaffManagement.tsx`.
    *   Research completion logic (updates `researchedMods`, staff status) added to `advanceDay` function in `useGameActions.tsx`.
    *   Placeholder `ResearchModal.tsx` created and integrated into `RightPanel.tsx` to trigger `startResearchMod`.
*   **New Minigames (Placeholder Integration):**
    *   `VocalTuningGame.tsx` created with basic UI and logic.
    *   `LiveRecordingGame.tsx` created with basic UI and logic.
    *   Both minigames added to `MinigameType` in `MinigameManager.tsx`.
    *   Render logic for both added to `MinigameManager.tsx`.
    *   Trigger conditions for both added to `getTriggeredMinigames` in `minigameUtils.ts`.
*   **Vercel Speed Insights:** Added `<SpeedInsights />` component to `src/main.tsx`.

## 2. What Works (Based on Inferred Codebase Structure & Task)

*   A foundational game structure exists (React, TypeScript, Vite).
*   Core game elements like artists, equipment, and a game loop are likely implemented to some degree (inferred from file names like `src/data/artistsData.ts`, `src/data/equipment.ts`, `src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx`).
*   A UI is in place, using an emoji-stylized design.
*   Systems for eras, projects, staff management, and minigames appear to be present.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Current Task Focus)

**Feature Set 1: Living Studio (Visuals & Animation)**
*   [X] Recording Animation (tape machine Î¶¥) - Added to ActiveProject
*   [X] Mixing Animation (mixing console üéõÔ∏è) - Added to ActiveProject
*   [X] Artist Mood Animations (‚ú® or üéµ) - MoodIndicator component created and added to BandManagement
*   [C] Equipment Status Animations (üí® or ‚ö†Ô∏è) - CSS styles created; UI integration deferred
*   [X] Day/Night Cycle background transition - Implemented in GameLayout

**Feature Set 2: Historical Evolution & Equipment Mods**
*   [X] New 1960s Equipment (Data Added):
    *   [X] EMT 140 Plate Reverb
    *   [X] Fairchild 670 compressor
    *   [X] UREI 1176 Compressor (Base item for modding)
*   [X] New 1970s Equipment (Data Added):
    *   [X] SSL 4000 series console
    *   [X] Lexicon 224 digital reverb (Early version)
*   [P] Equipment Modification System:
    *   [P] "Research" action for engineers (Core logic for starting/completing research is done. UI in `ResearchModal.tsx` is placeholder, needs full implementation for equipment/mod selection. Engineer skill checks for research requirements are TODO in `useStaffManagement.tsx`).
    *   [X] Data structures for equipment mods (Types defined, `equipmentMods.ts` created, `GameState` updated).
    *   [X] UREI 1176 "Rev A / Blue Stripe" mod definition added.
    *   [X] Helper function `getModifiedEquipment` created.
    *   [ ] UI indication for modified gear (Displaying modded name/stats, visual badge).
    *   [ ] Logic for applying mods (Player action to select a researched mod and apply it to an owned equipment instance).
    *   [ ] UI for applying mods.

**General Tasks:**
*   [X] Thorough analysis of existing documentation and code.
*   [X] Detailed implementation plan.
*   [P] Integration of new features into the existing codebase (Animations and core mod logic integrated. UI for mod system largely pending).
*   [P] Updating Memory Bank and other relevant documentation as features are implemented (Memory bank updated for current progress).

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **External URL Access:** Cannot directly access the GitHub URL provided for documentation. Will rely on local `docs/` content or user-provided information.
*   **Understanding Existing Systems:** A deep understanding of the current game loop, state management, and UI rendering is required before implementing new features. This is part of the "Analyze Existing Documentation & Code" step.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

*   **Initial Decision (2025-06-11):** Establish a comprehensive Memory Bank as the first step, per Cline's operational protocol. This ensures all subsequent work is well-grounded.
*   **Learning (2025-06-11):** The project uses a modern tech stack (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS), which is conducive to building complex UIs and game logic. Custom hooks and Context API are the current state management approach.
*   **Update (2025-06-11):** Successfully integrated several visual animations (recording, mixing, artist mood, day/night cycle) and laid data/logic groundwork for equipment mods (data structures, research initiation/completion). Fixed several pre-existing TypeScript errors. Added placeholders and basic integration for two new minigames (Vocal Tuning, Live Recording) as per user feedback. Integrated Vercel Speed Insights.
*   **Next Steps Focus:** Completing the UI for the equipment modification system (research selection, mod application, display of modded gear) and integrating the equipment status animations once a suitable UI location is determined. Flesh out the placeholder minigames.
