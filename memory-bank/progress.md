# Progress: Recording Studio Tycoon

**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2025-06-11
**Related Documents:** `activeContext.md`

## 1. Current Project Status

*   **Phase:** Initial feature enhancement phase.
*   **Overall Completion:** Low. The current task involves adding significant new features (animations, historical equipment, equipment modification system) to an existing base.
*   **Memory Bank:** Core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have just been initialized.

## 2. What Works (Based on Inferred Codebase Structure & Task)

*   A foundational game structure exists (React, TypeScript, Vite).
*   Core game elements like artists, equipment, and a game loop are likely implemented to some degree (inferred from file names like `src/data/artistsData.ts`, `src/data/equipment.ts`, `src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx`).
*   A UI is in place, using an emoji-stylized design.
*   Systems for eras, projects, staff management, and minigames appear to be present.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Current Task Focus)

**Feature Set 1: Living Studio (Visuals & Animation)**
*   [ ] Recording Animation (tape machine Î¶¥)
*   [ ] Mixing Animation (mixing console üéõÔ∏è)
*   [ ] Artist Mood Animations (‚ú® or üéµ)
*   [ ] Equipment Status Animations (üí® or ‚ö†Ô∏è)
*   [ ] Day/Night Cycle background transition

**Feature Set 2: Historical Evolution & Equipment Mods**
*   [ ] New 1960s Equipment:
    *   [ ] EMT 140 Plate Reverb
    *   [ ] Fairchild 670 compressor
*   [ ] New 1970s Equipment:
    *   [ ] SSL 4000 series console
    *   [ ] Lexicon 224 digital reverb
*   [ ] Equipment Modification System:
    *   [ ] "Research" action for engineers.
    *   [ ] Data structures for equipment mods.
    *   [ ] UREI 1176 "Rev A / Blue Stripe" mod implementation (visuals & stats).
    *   [ ] UI indication for modified gear.
    *   [ ] Logic for researching and applying mods.

**General Tasks:**
*   [ ] Thorough analysis of existing documentation and code.
*   [ ] Detailed implementation plan.
*   [ ] Integration of new features into the existing codebase.
*   [ ] Updating Memory Bank and other relevant documentation as features are implemented.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

*   **External URL Access:** Cannot directly access the GitHub URL provided for documentation. Will rely on local `docs/` content or user-provided information.
*   **Understanding Existing Systems:** A deep understanding of the current game loop, state management, and UI rendering is required before implementing new features. This is part of the "Analyze Existing Documentation & Code" step.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings

*   **Initial Decision (2025-06-11):** Establish a comprehensive Memory Bank as the first step, per Cline's operational protocol. This ensures all subsequent work is well-grounded.
*   **Learning (2025-06-11):** The project uses a modern tech stack (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS), which is conducive to building complex UIs and game logic. Custom hooks and Context API are the current state management approach.
