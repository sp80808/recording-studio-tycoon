## 1. Project Vision & Purpose

**Why does this project exist?**
Recording Studio Tycoon aims to provide an engaging and educational simulation experience centered around the fascinating world of music recording. It seeks to combine the strategic depth of tycoon games with the rich history of music technology and production, all presented in an accessible and charming emoji-stylized aesthetic. The game is evolving to allow players to manage a bustling studio with multiple concurrent projects and automated staff, enhancing the feeling of growth and managerial accomplishment.

**What problems does it solve for the player?**
*   **Lack of Engaging Music Industry Sims:** Many simulation games cover common themes, but few delve deeply into the creative and business aspects of the music industry, particularly from a historical perspective and with a satisfying sense of operational scale.
*   **Desire for Creative Management & Strategic Oversight:** Players often seek games where they can build, manage, and nurture something creative. The multi-project system will allow them to scale their operations, shifting focus from micromanagement to strategic oversight and studio development.
*   **Interest in Music History & Technology:** For players interested in how music is made and how technology has evolved, this game offers a playful way to explore these themes.
*   **Scaling Challenge:** Provides a satisfying progression path where players can grow from managing single projects to overseeing a complex, multi-project studio with automated workflows.

## 2. Core Gameplay & How It Should Work

**How should the game fundamentally operate?**
The game revolves around a core loop of:
1.  **Acquisition & Setup:** Acquiring a studio space, purchasing/upgrading equipment.
2.  **Talent Management:** Scouting, signing, and developing artists and staff (engineers, producers). Staff can eventually be assigned to work autonomously on projects.
3.  **Production Management:**
    *   Initially, direct management of recording sessions, mixing, and mastering tracks for single projects.
    *   Progressively, overseeing multiple concurrent projects, assigning staff, setting priorities, and managing automation settings. This includes managing artist mood, equipment condition, and engineer skills, which will factor into automation efficiency.
4.  **Release & Promotion:** Releasing music, managing marketing efforts, and climbing the charts.
5.  **Progression & Expansion:** Reinvesting profits into better equipment, larger facilities, more skilled personnel, and unlocking capabilities like multi-project management and advanced staff automation. Unlocking new eras and technologies over time remains key.

**What are the key player interactions?**
*   Making strategic decisions about resource allocation (money, time, staff across multiple projects).
*   Interacting with a UI that clearly presents information for both single-project details and a multi-project overview, allowing for intuitive control over studio operations and automation settings.
*   Responding to dynamic events (e.g., equipment breakdowns, artist demands, market trends, automation inefficiencies).
*   Engaging in light minigames for specific tasks (e.g., gear maintenance, or critical project stages not fully automated).
*   Configuring and optimizing staff automation, assigning staff to projects, and adjusting focus or priorities for automated tasks.
*   Expanding studio capacity to handle more concurrent projects.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

**What should the player feel?**
*   **Engaged:** The game should offer compelling choices and a satisfying sense of progression, from hands-on project work to strategic studio management.
*   **Creative & Managerial:** Players should feel like they are building a unique and successful recording empire, making both creative decisions on individual projects and strategic decisions about the studio's overall operation and growth.
*   **Challenged but Fair:** The game should present interesting challenges in managing resources, staff, and multiple projects without being overly punishing or obscure. Automation should feel like a powerful tool that still requires smart setup and oversight.
*   **Delighted:** The emoji-stylized visuals, animations (including feedback for automated work), and historical details should provide moments of charm and discovery. Watching your automated studio hum with activity should be satisfying.
*   **Informed & In Control:** The UI should be clear, providing necessary information for decision-making (for both individual projects and the multi-project view) without overwhelming the player. Automation controls should be intuitive.
*   **Sense of Accomplishment & Scale:** Successfully managing multiple projects simultaneously and building an efficient, automated studio should provide a strong sense of achievement.

**Key UX Principles:**
*   **Clarity:** Information should be easy to find and understand, especially with the added complexity of multiple projects.
*   **Feedback:** Player actions and automated processes should have clear and immediate visual and auditory feedback.
*   **Progression:** A tangible sense of growth from single-project management to overseeing a larger, automated operation.
*   **Charm:** Maintain and enhance the unique emoji-based aesthetic, extending it to new UI elements for multi-project management and automation feedback.
*   **Historical Immersion (Light):** Weave in historical details in a way that enriches the experience.
*   **Strategic Depth without Micromanagement Overload:** Automation should reduce tedious micromanagement, allowing players to focus on higher-level strategy as their studio grows.
