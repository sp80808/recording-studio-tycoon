## 1. Project Vision & Purpose

**Why does this project exist?**
Recording Studio Tycoon aims to provide an engaging and educational simulation experience centered around the fascinating world of music recording. It seeks to combine the strategic depth of tycoon games with the rich history of music technology and production, all presented in an accessible and charming emoji-stylized aesthetic.

**What problems does it solve for the player?**
*   **Lack of Engaging Music Industry Sims:** Many simulation games cover common themes (cities, hospitals, etc.), but few delve deeply into the creative and business aspects of the music industry, particularly from a historical perspective.
*   **Desire for Creative Management:** Players often seek games where they can build, manage, and nurture something creative, seeing tangible results from their strategic decisions.
*   **Interest in Music History & Technology:** For players interested in how music is made and how technology has evolved, this game offers a playful way to explore these themes.

## 2. Core Gameplay & How It Should Work

**How should the game fundamentally operate?**
The game should revolve around a core loop of:
1.  **Acquisition & Setup:** Acquiring a studio space, purchasing/upgrading equipment.
2.  **Talent Management:** Scouting, signing, and developing artists and staff (engineers, producers).
3.  **Production:** Managing recording sessions, mixing, and mastering tracks. This includes managing artist mood, equipment condition, and engineer skills.
4.  **Release & Promotion:** Releasing music, managing marketing efforts, and climbing the charts.
5.  **Progression & Expansion:** Reinvesting profits into better equipment, larger facilities, and more skilled personnel, unlocking new eras and technologies over time.

**What are the key player interactions?**
*   Making strategic decisions about resource allocation (money, time, staff).
*   Interacting with a UI that clearly presents information and allows for intuitive control over studio operations.
*   Responding to dynamic events (e.g., equipment breakdowns, artist demands, market trends).
*   Engaging in light minigames for specific tasks (e.g., gear maintenance).

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

**What should the player feel?**
*   **Engaged:** The game should offer compelling choices and a satisfying sense of progression.
*   **Creative:** Players should feel like they are building a unique and successful recording empire.
*   **Challenged but Fair:** The game should present interesting challenges without being overly punishing or obscure.
*   **Delighted:** The emoji-stylized visuals, animations, and historical details should provide moments of charm and discovery.
*   **Informed:** The UI should be clear, providing necessary information for decision-making without overwhelming the player.

**Key UX Principles:**
*   **Clarity:** Information should be easy to find and understand.
*   **Feedback:** Player actions should have clear and immediate visual and auditory feedback.
*   **Progression:** A tangible sense of growth and accomplishment.
*   **Charm:** Maintain and enhance the unique emoji-based aesthetic.
*   **Historical Immersion (Light):** Weave in historical details in a way that enriches the experience without requiring deep prior knowledge.
