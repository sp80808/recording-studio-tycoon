# Recording Studio Tycoon - Progression System Plan

## Goal

To define a clear and interconnected progression system that rewards players for their actions (working on projects, training staff, acquiring equipment) and unlocks new capabilities and content, providing a sense of growth and accomplishment.

## Key Components of Progression

1.  **Player Level:** Represents the overall progression of the player as a studio owner/producer.
2.  **Studio Skill Levels:** Represents the studio's expertise in different music genres or technical areas (e.g., Rock, Pop, Mixing, Mastering).
3.  **Staff Role Levels:** Represents the individual growth and expertise of hired staff members in their specific roles (e.g., Engineer, Producer).
4.  **Reputation:** Represents the studio's standing in the music industry.
5.  **Financial Status:** Money earned and spent.

## How Progression Happens

*   **Player Level:** Primarily increases based on the cumulative levels of Studio Skills or by completing significant milestones (e.g., high-difficulty projects).
*   **Studio Skill Levels:** Increase by gaining XP through:
    *   Working on projects of a specific genre or focus area.
    *   Completing relevant training courses.
    *   Acquiring certain equipment (e.g., genre-specific instruments, processors).
*   **Staff Role Levels:** Increase by gaining XP through:
    *   Working on projects.
    *   Completing training courses.
    *   Mentorship from higher-level staff or the player (future feature).
*   **Reputation:** Primarily gained by completing projects, with higher difficulty and quality projects yielding more reputation.
*   **Financial Status:** Managed through project payouts, staff salaries, equipment purchases, training costs, etc.

## Benefits of Progression

*   **Player Level:**
    *   Gain Attribute Points to improve player attributes (Creative Intuition, Technical Aptitude, etc.).
    *   Unlock new staff recruitment tiers or roles.
    *   Access higher difficulty or more lucrative projects.
    *   Unlock certain advanced features or buildings (future feature).
*   **Studio Skill Levels:**
    *   Improve effectiveness in related project stages (e.g., higher Mixing skill improves mixing stage output).
    *   Unlock advanced training courses related to that skill.
    *   Unlock access to purchase specific high-end equipment.
    *   Attract clients with projects requiring that specific expertise.
*   **Staff Role Levels:**
    *   Improve staff primary stats and efficiency.
    *   Unlock Staff Specializations (e.g., Audio Engineer -> Mixing Virtuoso).
    *   Gain Staff Perks (passive bonuses for the staff member or the studio).
    *   Reduce energy drain or training time.
*   **Reputation:**
    *   Unlock access to higher-paying and higher-difficulty clients/projects.
    *   Reduce the likelihood of negative random events.
    *   Increase the base reputation gain from projects.

## Interdependencies

*   Player level is tied to Studio Skill levels.\n*   Studio Skill levels can unlock Staff Training and Equipment.\n*   Staff levels and specializations can improve project work speed, quality, and C/T generation, influencing Studio Skill XP and project outcomes.\n*   Equipment can boost Studio Skill XP gain and affect project outcomes, influencing both Player and Staff progression.\n*   Reputation and Money gate access to better projects, staff, and equipment, which in turn fuel further progression.\n
## Implementation Notes/Considerations

*   Define clear XP thresholds for each level for Player, Studio Skills, and Staff Roles.\n*   Balance XP gain sources (projects, training) to ensure a steady but not too rapid progression.\n*   Design tangible and impactful benefits for each level/tier across all progression tracks.\n*   Ensure UI clearly communicates progression status (XP bars, levels, unlocked content).\n*   Consider adding visual cues or notifications for leveling up or unlocking content.\n
