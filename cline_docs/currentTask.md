# Current Task: Plan Unity Game Engine Integration

## Current Objectives
- Analyze the feasibility and approach for bridging the existing React/TypeScript project ("Recording Studio Tycoon") into the Unity game engine.
- Evaluate potential bridging technologies, specifically OneJS (based on the provided PDF) and Preactor (based on the provided GitHub link), and any other relevant alternatives.
- Develop a high-level plan for this integration, considering UI, game logic, and multi-platform porting (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS).
- Document this plan, including architectural considerations, potential challenges, and next steps.

## Relevant Context
- **Project:** Recording Studio Tycoon (currently a web application using React and TypeScript).
- **Goal:** Port the game to native desktop and mobile platforms using Unity.
- **Provided Resources:**
    - PDF detailing OneJS for React/TailwindCSS in Unity.
    - GitHub link for Preactor (Unity/React bridging).
- **Task Reference in projectRoadmap.md:** "Plan and Design Unity Game Engine Integration"

## Next Steps
1. Create `cline_docs/techStack.md` and `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md` with initial placeholder content.
2. Read the core project memory files as per `.cursor/rules/memory.mdc`:
    - `docs/architecture.md`
    - `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`
    - `docs/technical.md`
    - `tasks/active_context.md`
    - `tasks/tasks_plan.md`
3. Analyze the provided PDF on OneJS and the GitHub page for Preactor.
4. Formulate a detailed plan for the Unity integration.
5. Present the plan to the user for feedback and approval.
