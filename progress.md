# Progress: Recording Studio Tycoon

## What Works

- Created `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to establish a solid foundation for development.
- Analyzed documentation in the `docs` directory to understand the project's scope and requirements.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement the basic charts system, artist contact system, and market analysis tools (Phase 2).
- Develop enhanced minigames and collaborative features (Phase 3).
- Implement era-based progression and historical events (Phase 4).
- Create an A&R department and advanced business operations (Phase 5).

## Current Status

- Phase 1 (Core Enhancements) is partially complete (see `ADVANCED_PROGRESSION_PLAN.md` for details).
- Currently working on Phase 2: Charts & Industry Integration.

## Known Issues

- The `techContext.md` file contains placeholders for information that needs to be determined.
- Performance optimization may be required as new features are added.
- Balancing the complexity of new systems with the need for accessibility.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project has evolved from a simple studio simulator to a comprehensive music industry simulation.
- The focus has shifted from individual tasks to strategic decision-making and long-term planning.
- The importance of historical accuracy and educational value has increased.
