# Product Context: Recording Studio Tycoon

## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to enhance Recording Studio Tycoon by adding depth, historical accuracy, and player engagement. The goal is to transform the game into a comprehensive music industry simulation that is both educational and entertaining.

## Problems It Solves

- Lack of Depth: The current game lacks long-term goals and strategic choices.
- Limited Industry Interaction: The studio operates in isolation, without connection to the broader music industry.
- Missing Historical Context: The game does not reflect the evolution of music production and business.
- Repetitive Gameplay: Core tasks become repetitive without new challenges and mechanics.

## How It Should Work

The enhanced game should:

- Simulate a dynamic music industry with real-time charts and trends.
- Allow players to build relationships with artists and industry professionals.
- Provide skill-based minigames that reflect real studio tasks.
- Offer a historical journey through music industry evolution.
- Present players with meaningful choices and long-term consequences.

## User Experience Goals

- Engaging Gameplay: Players should be motivated to play for extended sessions.
- Educational Value: Players should learn about music history and production.
- Strategic Depth: Players should have multiple paths to success.
- Rewarding Progression: Players should feel a sense of accomplishment as they advance.
- Accessible Design: The game should be easy to learn but difficult to master.
