# Current Development Task - Recording Studio Tycoon
*Updated: June 11, 2025*

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: Gameplay Depth, UX, Minigames, Automation & Visual Feedback

Following the successful implementation of the Multi-Project Staff Automation System (Phase 1) and recent UI/UX enhancements (including text-based save/load), the current focus is on deepening core gameplay mechanics, enhancing user experience with improved automation and visual feedback, and expanding minigame content.

### âœ… Recently Completed (June 11) - MAJOR MILESTONES
1.  **Multi-Project Staff Automation System (Phase 1 Core Infrastructure)**
    *   **Details**: Comprehensive system allowing management of 2-5 concurrent projects with intelligent staff automation, progressive unlocking based on player advancement, and a dedicated multi-project dashboard.
    *   **Impact**: Revolutionizes gameplay by scaling studio management capabilities, reducing micromanagement, and enabling advanced strategic depth.
    *   **Key Components**: `ProjectManager` service, `ProgressiveProjectInterface`, `useMultiProjectManagement` hook, `EnhancedGameState`.
    *   *(Reference: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_2025-06-11_UPDATED.md`)*

2.  **UI Layout Enhancements**
    *   **Details**: Refactored main game layout (`GameLayout`, `Index` page, `MainGameContent`, `ProgressiveProjectInterface`) using flexbox. Content panels now correctly fill available vertical space in fullscreen mode, and main content areas are scrollable in windowed mode.
    *   **Impact**: Significantly improved UI adaptability and usability across different screen sizes and modes.

3.  **Notification System Standardization**
    *   **Details**: Unified all toast notifications with consistent styling (dark theme, emojis) across the entire codebase.
    *   **Impact**: Professional and consistent user experience for all in-game feedback.
    *   *(Reference: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_2025-06-11_UPDATED.md`)*

4.  **Era Progression System Fixes**
    *   **Details**: Restored the day button click to era progress modal workflow by fixing `triggerEraTransition` and ensuring correct prop flow.
    *   **Impact**: Core gameplay loop for era progression is now fully functional.
    *   *(Reference: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_2025-06-11_UPDATED.md`)*

5.  **Accessibility & UX Improvements (WCAG 2 AA)**
    *   **Details**: Added ARIA labels to progress bars, enhanced visual contrast for key UI elements, and fixed various runtime/sound errors.
    *   **Impact**: Improved accessibility and overall polish of the user interface.
    *   *(Reference: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_2025-06-11_UPDATED.md`)*

### âœ… Previously Completed (June 10)
1.  **Sound Effects Integration** - Enhanced UI feedback with audio cues
    *   **Added**: Comprehensive sound utility system (`src/utils/soundUtils.ts`)
    *   **Integration**: Button clicks, slider adjustments, minigame rewards, project completion.
2.  **Documentation Expansion** - Created comprehensive documentation suite
    *   **Created**: `SOUND_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `VISUAL_POLISH_ANIMATION_SYSTEM.md`, etc.
3.  **Animation System Enhancements** - Improved visual feedback
    *   **Enhanced**: `AnimatedStatBlobs`, project completion celebration timing.

### âœ… Previously Completed (June 9)
1.  **Fixed Duplicate Notification Issue** - Kept only green toast for equipment purchase.
2.  **Version Update** - `package.json` to 0.3.1.
3.  **Fixed Project Completion Screen Timing**.
4.  **Restored ActiveProject Component**.
5.  **Sound Effects Integration** (Initial pass).

### âœ… Previously Completed (June 8)
1.  **Created EffectChainGame.tsx**.
2.  **Created AcousticTreatmentGame.tsx**.
3.  **Created InstrumentLayeringGame.tsx**.
4.  **Updated MinigameManager.tsx**.
5.  **Enhanced minigameUtils.ts**.
6.  **Background Music Timing Optimization**.

### ðŸš§ Next Immediate Tasks (Priority Order - Reflecting New Focus)

1.  **Automatic Focus Slider Adjustment & Visual Feedback (High Priority)**
    *   [ ] Enhance optimal focus calculation to consider assigned staff skills.
    *   [ ] Trigger automatic focus adjustment in `assignStaffToProject` (or equivalent automation logic) by calling `setFocusAllocation`.
    *   [ ] Implement color-change visual feedback on sliders in `ActiveProject.tsx` to indicate optimal settings.
    *   [ ] Verify and ensure fully automatic project progression post-staff assignment when automation is active.

2.  **Minigame Implementation & Enhancements (High Priority)**
    *   [ ] Plan and begin implementation of a new minigame (e.g., "Gear Maintenance Minigame" or another based on documentation).
    *   [ ] Focus on rich "visual playback feedback" for new and existing minigames.

3.  **Animation & Visual Polish (High Priority - Ongoing)**
    *   [ ] Continue work on `AnimatedProjectCard` with work intensity indicators, progress animations, and staff activity visualization.
    *   [ ] Integrate real-time project state animations with staff automation actions.
    *   [ ] Add smooth transitions for project progression milestones and automation state changes.

4.  **Testing & Validation (Critical - Ongoing)**
    *   [ ] Test progression system across all milestone levels (Level 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 5 â†’ 8 â†’ 12).
    *   [ ] Validate staff optimization algorithms with various staff configurations.
    *   [ ] Ensure automation efficiency calculations work correctly across different project types.
    *   [ ] Test save/load compatibility with new multi-project game state.

4.  **Integration Refinement (Medium Priority)**
    *   [ ] Resolve any remaining TypeScript compilation issues.
    *   [ ] Optimize performance for maximum concurrent projects (5 projects + full automation).
    *   [ ] Further ensure responsive design works across all device sizes.
    *   [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) where still needed.

5.  **Broader Documentation Review (Ongoing)**
    *   [ ] Review and update other specified documents in the `docs/` folder for necessary updates related to recent changes.
    *   [ ] Update `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` or determine if it's still needed.
    *   [ ] Update Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect new features (automatic sliders, minigame work) as they are implemented.

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Project Status (Phase Assessment)

*   **Multi-Project Automation System**: Phase 1 Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE.
*   **Settings & Save/Load**: Splash screen settings button and Text-based Save/Load system âœ… COMPLETE.
*   **UI/UX & Accessibility**: Significant enhancements âœ… COMPLETE.
*   **Advanced Minigames**: âœ… COMPLETE (as per previous status).
*   **Overall**: The game has taken a major leap forward. Focus is now on stabilizing, polishing the new systems, and preparing for the next wave of features (Advanced Automation - Phase 2).

### ðŸš€ Immediate Priorities (Next Development Session)

The immediate goal is to implement automatic focus slider adjustments with visual feedback, followed by minigame development and continued animation polish.

---

**Next Session Goal**: Successfully implement automatic focus slider adjustments and visual feedback. Begin planning or implementing the next minigame. Make progress on `AnimatedProjectCard` and other visual polish tasks.
