### 2. Comprehensive Notification System Standardization

**✅ UI/UX Polish & Consistency Improvements - COMPLETED**

#### Notification System Overhaul
- **Visual Consistency**: Standardized all toast notifications across the entire codebase
- **Equipment Purchase Style**: Applied consistent styling (`bg-gray-800 border-gray-600 text-white`)
- **Emoji Integration**: Added relevant emojis to all notification titles for better visual scanning
- **Professional Appearance**: Created unified notification experience throughout the game

#### Updated Files & Notifications
- **useGameLogic.tsx**: Production bonuses, attribute upgrades, artist interactions, equipment purchases
- **useStaffManagement.tsx**: Hiring, training, assignments, bonuses, research notifications
- **useGameActions.tsx**: Era transitions, salary payments, candidate refreshes, milestone notifications
- **useBandManagement.tsx**: Band creation, tour management, track production notifications
- **useStageWork.tsx**: Work progress, stage completion, energy management notifications
- **useProjectManagement.tsx**: Project start/completion notifications
- **Component Notifications**: ActiveProject, MinigameManager, modals, and more

#### Notification Categories with Emojis
```typescript
// Examples of standardized notifications:
"💰 Equipment Purchased!" // Purchases & transactions
"🎯 Production Bonus!" // Gameplay rewards
"👥 Staff Hired!" // Staff management
"📚 Training Started!" // Learning & development
"🎸 Band Created!" // Creative activities
"🚌 Tour Started!" // Business operations
"🎉 Stage Complete!" // Progress milestones
"❌ Insufficient Funds" // Error states
"⚡ No Energy Left" // Resource limitations
```

### 3. Era Progression System Fixes

**✅ Core Gameplay Flow Restoration - COMPLETED**

#### Era Progress Modal Integration
- **Fixed triggerEraTransition Function**: Properly connected era transition system
- **GameHeader.tsx Updates**: Added missing `triggerEraTransition` prop to header component
- **MainGameContent.tsx Integration**: Ensured proper prop flow through component hierarchy
- **EraProgressModal Functionality**: Restored day button click → era progress modal workflow

#### Prop Flow Restoration
```typescript
// Fixed component hierarchy:
Index.tsx → MainGameContent.tsx → GameHeader.tsx → EraProgressModal
// With proper triggerEraTransition function passing
```

### 4. Accessibility & UX Improvements

**✅ WCAG 2 AA Compliance Enhancements**

#### ARIA Accessibility
- **Progress Bar Labels**: Added descriptive aria-label attributes to all Progress components:
  - Project progress indicators
  - Staff energy displays  
  - Milestone progression bars
  - XP progress tracking
- **Enhanced Progress Component**: Added proper ARIA attributes (valuemax, valuemin, valuenow)

#### Visual Contrast Improvements
- **Color Accessibility**: Enhanced contrast ratios for:
  - Priority badges (red, orange, yellow → darker variants)
  - Status indicators (green, yellow, red → 600-level variants)
  - Progress bar backgrounds and text
  - Notification styling with proper dark theme contrast
- **Dark Theme Consistency**: 
  - Studio progression panel updated to dark gray (bg-gray-800)
  - Alert notifications with proper contrast
  - Unified notification styling across all components

#### Error Fixes
- **Sound System**: Fixed missing audio file error (`purchase.wav` → `ui sfx/purchase-complete.mp3`)
- **Focus Allocation**: Resolved undefined property errors by:
  - Adding proper default values for focusAllocation
  - Ensuring all ActiveProject instances receive required props
  - Implementing graceful fallbacks for optional props
- **Runtime Errors**: Fixed `performDailyWork is not a function` error in ActiveProject.tsx

## 📋 Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Highlights
```typescript
// Progression-based unlocking
if (level >= 3 && staff >= 2 && projects >= 3) {
  enableMultiProjectMode();
}

// Smart staff allocation
const assignments = optimizeStaffAssignments(projects, staff, settings);

// Automatic capacity scaling  
const maxProjects = Math.min(5, baseCapacity + equipmentBonus + staffBonus);

// Standardized notifications
toast({
  title: "🎯 Action Complete!",
  description: "Descriptive message with context",
  className: "bg-gray-800 border-gray-600 text-white",
