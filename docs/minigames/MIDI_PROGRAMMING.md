# MIDI Programming Minigame

## Overview
The MIDI Programming minigame simulates the experience of programming MIDI sequences in a digital audio workstation. Players are challenged to create musical patterns across multiple tracks while matching target patterns and managing the complexity of different instruments.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Core Features
- **Multi-track Sequencing**: Work with 4 different tracks (Bass, Lead, Pad, Drums)
- **16-step Sequencer**: Program notes across a 16-step grid for each track
- **Real-time Playback**: Hear your patterns as you create them
- **Pattern Matching**: Score points by matching your sequence to the target pattern
- **Time Management**: Complete the challenge within 120 seconds

### Controls
- **Note Placement**: Click on grid positions to place notes
- **Note Removal**: Click on existing notes to remove them
- **Track Management**: 
  - Mute (M): Toggle track muting
  - Solo (S): Toggle track soloing
- **Playback**: Automatic playback at 120 BPM

### Scoring System
The score is calculated based on:
1. **Note Accuracy**: Matching pitch, timing, and duration
2. **Velocity Accuracy**: Matching note velocities
3. **Pattern Completeness**: Penalties for missing notes
4. **Time Bonus**: Faster completion yields higher scores

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
interface Note {
  pitch: number;
  velocity: number;
  startStep: number;
  duration: number;
}

interface Track {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  notes: Note[];
  isMuted: boolean;
  isSolo: boolean;
}
```

### Pattern Generation
- Target patterns are generated based on difficulty level
- Each track gets 4-12 random notes
- Notes are distributed across the 16-step grid
- Velocities range from 0.5 to 1.0

### Audio Integration
- Uses the `useSound` hook for sound effects
- Supports real-time playback of programmed patterns
- Visual feedback through VU meters

## Requirements

### Equipment
- MIDI Controller
- Digital Workstation

### Skills
- Programming Level 3

### Game Stages
- Recording
- Editing

## Tips for Success
1. Start with the bass track to establish the foundation
2. Use mute/solo to focus on specific tracks
3. Pay attention to note velocities for better accuracy
4. Plan your pattern before placing notes
5. Use the real-time playback to check your progress

## Future Enhancements
- Note length control
- Pitch selection interface
- Pattern saving/loading
- More track types
- Advanced effects routing
- Automation support
