# Minigame System Documentation

## Overview

The minigame system in Recording Studio Tycoon provides interactive challenges that simulate real-world studio tasks, offering skill-based rewards and era-appropriate gameplay. Minigames are dynamically triggered based on project context, player equipment, focus allocation, and the current era.

## Core Components

### 1. Minigame Types
```typescript
export type MinigameType = 
  // Core minigames
  | 'rhythm'
  | 'mixing'
  | 'waveform'
  | 'beatmaking'
  | 'vocal'
  | 'mastering'
  | 'effectchain'
  | 'acoustic'
  | 'layering'
  // Analog Era (1960s-1970s)
  | 'tape_splicing'
  | 'four_track_recording'
  // Digital Era (1980s-1990s)
  | 'midi_programming'
  | 'digital_mixing'
  // Internet Era (2000s-2010s)
  | 'sample_editing'
  | 'sound_design'
  // Streaming Era (2020s+)
  | 'audio_restoration';
```

### 2. Minigame Manager
The `MinigameManager` component serves as the central controller for all minigames, handling:
- Minigame initialization and cleanup
- State management
- Reward distribution
- UI transitions
- Difficulty scaling

```typescript
interface MinigameManagerProps {
  type: MinigameType;
  difficulty: number;
  onComplete: (score: number) => void;
  onFail: () => void;
  onClose: () => void;
  initialProgress: PlayerProgress;
}
```

### 3. Base Minigame Interface
All minigames implement this base interface:
```typescript
interface BaseMinigameProps {
  type: MinigameType;
  difficulty: number;
  onComplete: (score: number) => void;
  onFail: () => void;
  onClose: () => void;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

## Era-Specific Minigames

### Analog Era (1960s-1970s)
1. **Tape Splicing**

   - Manage track bouncing
   - Balance recording quality

### Digital Era (1980s-1990s)
1. **MIDI Programming**
   - Create and edit MIDI sequences
   - Manage timing and quantization
   - Control velocity sensitivity

2. **Digital Mixing**
   - Multi-channel mixing
   - Advanced EQ and effects
   - Bus routing and automation

### Internet Era (2000s-2010s)
1. **Sample Editing**
   - Waveform visualization
   - Sample manipulation
   - Effects processing
   - Multi-sample management

2. **Sound Design**
   - Multiple synthesis methods
   - Sound processing
   - Category-specific design
   - Advanced tools

### Streaming Era (2020s+)
1. **Audio Restoration**
   - Noise reduction
   - Audio repair
   - Quality enhancement
   - Modern processing techniques

## Integration Systems

### 1. Equipment Impact
- Higher quality equipment provides gameplay advantages
- Special equipment unlocks unique minigame features
- Equipment condition affects minigame difficulty
- Maintenance requirements add strategic depth

### 2. Staff Collaboration
- Staff skills directly impact minigame outcomes
- Training staff improves collaborative performance
- Different staff combinations create unique experiences
- Staff fatigue affects assistance quality

### 3. Project Integration
- Minigame performance affects project quality
- Different project types require different minigames
- Client preferences influence minigame selection
- Project deadlines add time pressure elements

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Efficient audio processing for real-time feedback
- GPU-accelerated visual effects
- Predictive loading for seamless transitions
- Memory management for complex audio samples

### 2. Data Persistence
- Individual minigame statistics
- Skill progression tracking
- Achievement progress
- Personal best records

### 3. Accessibility Features
- Visual indicators for audio cues
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Customizable controls
- Audio descriptions for visual elements

## Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**
   - Use `BaseMinigame` for consistent UI/logic
   - Implement game-specific logic in child components
   - Use Framer Motion for animations

2. **State Management**
   - Keep game state local to the component
   - Use React hooks for state management
   - Implement cleanup in useEffect

3. **Performance**
   - Use React.memo for static components
   - Implement proper cleanup for animations
   - Optimize re-renders with useCallback/useMemo

4. **Accessibility**
   - Include keyboard controls
   - Provide clear visual feedback
   - Support screen readers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Virtual Reality Integration**
   - Full studio environment immersion
   - Hand tracking for natural interactions
   - Spatial audio production in VR
   - Collaborative VR sessions

2. **AI-Powered Adaptation**
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment
   - Personalized challenge generation
   - Predictive assistance timing
   - Custom training regimens

3. **Community Features**
   - Leaderboards
   - Shared challenges
   - Collaborative projects
   - Mentorship systems

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Minigame not triggering**
   - Check trigger conditions
   - Verify equipment requirements
   - Confirm era compatibility

2. **Rewards not applying**
