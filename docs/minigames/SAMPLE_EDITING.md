## Technical Details

### Waveform Generation
```typescript
const generateWaveform = (length: number): number[] => {
  const waveform: number[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    // Generate a more complex waveform with harmonics
    const t = i / length;
    const fundamental = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * t);
    const harmonic1 = 0.5 * Math.sin(4 * Math.PI * t);
    const harmonic2 = 0.25 * Math.sin(6 * Math.PI * t);
    waveform.push(fundamental + harmonic1 + harmonic2);
  }
  return waveform;
};
```

### Time-Stretching Algorithm
```typescript
const timeStretch = (sample: Sample, newLength: number): Sample => {
  const stretchedWaveform: number[] = [];
  const ratio = newLength / sample.waveform.length;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < newLength; i++) {
    const position = i / ratio;
    const index = Math.floor(position);
    const fraction = position - index;
    
    // Linear interpolation
    const value = sample.waveform[index] * (1 - fraction) +
                 sample.waveform[Math.min(index + 1, sample.waveform.length - 1)] * fraction;
    
    stretchedWaveform.push(value);
  }
  
  return { ...sample, waveform: stretchedWaveform };
};
```

### Effect Processing Chain
```typescript
const processEffects = (sample: Sample): Sample => {
  let processedWaveform = [...sample.waveform];
  
  // Apply effects in sequence
  if (sample.effects.reverb > 0) {
    processedWaveform = applyReverb(processedWaveform, sample.effects.reverb);
  }
  
  if (sample.effects.delay > 0) {
    processedWaveform = applyDelay(processedWaveform, sample.effects.delay);
  }
  
  if (sample.effects.filter > 0) {
    processedWaveform = applyFilter(processedWaveform, sample.effects.filter);
  }
  
  // Apply modulation effects
  if (sample.effects.modulation > 0) {
    processedWaveform = applyModulation(processedWaveform, sample.effects.modulation);
  }
  
  return { ...sample, waveform: processedWaveform };
};
```

### Sample Scoring System
```typescript
const calculateSampleScore = (sample: Sample, target: Sample): number => {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Parameter accuracy
  const parameterScore = calculateParameterScore(sample, target);
  score += parameterScore * 0.4;
  
  // Effect accuracy
  const effectScore = calculateEffectScore(sample.effects, target.effects);
  score += effectScore * 0.3;
  
  // Waveform similarity
  const waveformScore = calculateWaveformSimilarity(sample.waveform, target.waveform);
  score += waveformScore * 0.3;
  
  return score;
};
```
