# Active Context: Recording Studio Tycoon

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on Phase 2: Charts & Industry Integration. This involves implementing the basic charts system, artist contact system, and market analysis tools.

## Recent Changes

- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` to define project goals and context.
- Analyzed documentation in the `docs` directory to understand the project's scope and requirements.
- Implemented initial UI polish and subtle animations, including:
    - Redesigned sliders for a thicker appearance and visual feedback.
    - Added subtle scale animations to buttons on active state.
    - Enhanced chart entry cards with hover effects (lift and shadow).
    - Improved audio playback button animations and progress bar transition in the ChartsPanel.
- Rolled back Charts Panel UI to a simpler layout, preserving audio playback and artist contact features.

## Next Steps

1.  Continue implementing the basic charts system, including chart generation and updating.
2.  Implement the basic charts system, including chart generation and updating.
3.  Create an artist database with dynamic availability.
4.  Develop a communication system foundation for artist contact.
5.  Implement a basic project matching algorithm and response time simulation.
6.  Plan and implement the track release, promotion, review, and hype system.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- How to balance historical accuracy with engaging gameplay.
- How to design a modular system architecture for scalability.
- How to optimize performance for mobile devices.
- How to create a user-friendly interface for complex systems.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Modular design: Systems should be designed as independent modules.
- Data-driven approach: Game logic should be driven by data and configurations.
- Historical accuracy: Equipment and trends should match real music history.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project requires a deep understanding of music industry dynamics.
- A modular architecture is crucial for managing complexity.
- Performance optimization is essential for a smooth user experience.
