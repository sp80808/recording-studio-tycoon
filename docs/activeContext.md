# Active Context: Recording Studio Tycoon

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on Phase 2: Charts & Industry Integration. This involves implementing the basic charts system, artist contact system, and market analysis tools.

## Recent Changes

- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` to define project goals and context.
- Analyzed documentation in the `docs` directory to understand the project's scope and requirements.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the basic charts system, including chart generation and updating.
2. Create an artist database with dynamic availability.
3. Develop a communication system foundation for artist contact.
4. Implement a basic project matching algorithm and response time simulation.
5. Plan and implement the track release, promotion, review, and hype system.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- How to balance historical accuracy with engaging gameplay.
- How to design a modular system architecture for scalability.
- How to optimize performance for mobile devices.
- How to create a user-friendly interface for complex systems.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Modular design: Systems should be designed as independent modules.
- Data-driven approach: Game logic should be driven by data and configurations.
- Historical accuracy: Equipment and trends should match real music history.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project requires a deep understanding of music industry dynamics.
- A modular architecture is crucial for managing complexity.
- Performance optimization is essential for a smooth user experience.
