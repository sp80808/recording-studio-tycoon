  const project: Project = {
    id: generateProjectId(),
    title: generateProjectTitle(clientRequest.genre),
    genre: clientRequest.genre,
    clientType: clientRequest.clientType,
    difficulty: calculateDifficulty(clientRequest, studioCapabilities),
    stages: generateProjectStages(clientRequest),
    payoutBase: calculatePayout(clientRequest, studioCapabilities),
    // ... additional properties
  };
  
  return project;
};
```

### Stage Progression System
```typescript
interface ProjectStage {
  id: string;
  stageName: string;
  workUnitsBase: number;
  workUnitsCompleted: number;
  completed: boolean;
  requirements: StageRequirement[];
  availableMinigames: MinigameType[];
  focusRecommendations: FocusAllocation;
}
```

#### Stage Types
1. **Setup Stages**: Room preparation, equipment setup
2. **Recording Stages**: Instrument and vocal capture
3. **Production Stages**: Editing, mixing, effects
4. **Mastering Stages**: Final polish and preparation

#### Staff Allocation
```typescript
interface StaffAssignment {
  staffId: string;
  role: StaffRole;
  efficiency: number;
  specialtyBonus: number;
  availabilityHours: number;
}

const assignStaffToProject = (project: Project, staff: StaffMember[]) => {
  const assignments = optimizeStaffAssignment(project.requirements, staff);
  return applyStaffEfficiencyToProject(project, assignments);
};
```

#### Equipment Utilization
```typescript
interface EquipmentUsage {
  equipmentId: string;
  stage: ProjectStage;
  utilizationRate: number;
  qualityImpact: number;
  maintenanceWear: number;
}
```

### Focus Allocation System

#### Dynamic Focus Recommendations
```typescript
const calculateOptimalFocus = (stage: ProjectStage, equipment: Equipment[]) => {
  const stageRequirements = analyzeStageRequirements(stage);
  const equipmentCapabilities = assessEquipmentCapabilities(equipment);
  
  return {
    performance: calculatePerformanceFocus(stageRequirements, equipmentCapabilities),
    soundCapture: calculateCaptureFocus(stageRequirements, equipmentCapabilities),
    layering: calculateLayeringFocus(stageRequirements, equipmentCapabilities)
  };
};
```

#### Focus Impact on Outcomes
- **Performance Focus**: Affects rhythm, timing, and musical expression
- **Sound Capture Focus**: Influences recording quality and technical precision
- **Layering Focus**: Impacts arrangement complexity and production depth

## Quality and Progression Systems

### Project Quality Metrics
```typescript
interface ProjectQuality {
  technicalQuality: number;    // 0-100, based on technical execution
  creativeQuality: number;     // 0-100, based on creative decisions
  commercialAppeal: number;    // 0-100, market viability
  clientSatisfaction: number;  // 0-100, meeting client expectations
  timelinePenalty: number;     // Deduction for deadline issues
  budgetEfficiency: number;    // Bonus for under-budget completion
}
```

### Reward Calculation
```typescript
const calculateProjectRewards = (project: Project, quality: ProjectQuality) => {
  const baseReward = project.payoutBase;
  const qualityMultiplier = (quality.technicalQuality + quality.creativeQuality) / 200;
  const timelineBonus = calculateTimelineBonus(project.deadline, project.completionDate);
  const clientBonus = calculateClientSatisfactionBonus(quality.clientSatisfaction);
  
  return {
    money: Math.floor(baseReward * qualityMultiplier + timelineBonus),
    xp: calculateXPReward(project.difficulty, quality),
    reputation: calculateReputationGain(quality, project.clientType),
    perkPoints: calculatePerkPoints(project.difficulty, quality.overallScore)
  };
};
```
