## Technical Architecture

### Core System Design
```typescript
// Modular Architecture
interface GameSystem {
  initialize(): void;
  update(deltaTime: number): void;
  handleEvent(event: GameEvent): void;
  getState(): SystemState;
  saveState(): SaveData;
  loadState(data: SaveData): void;
}

// Plugin System
interface GamePlugin {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  initialize(game: GameInstance): void;
  hooks: PluginHook[];
}
```

### Data Management
```typescript
// Centralized State Management
interface GameState {
  core: CoreGameState;
  charts: ChartsState;
  communication: CommunicationState;
  eras: EraState;
  ar: ARState;
  plugins: PluginState[];
}

// Event System
interface EventBus {
  subscribe(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  unsubscribe(event: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
  emit(event: string, data: any): void;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load features as they become available
- **State Serialization**: Efficient save/load system
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of large datasets
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking chart updates and AI calculations
- **Caching**: Intelligent data caching for frequently accessed information

### Scalability Planning
```typescript
// Feature Flag System
interface FeatureFlags {
  chartsSystem: boolean;
  communicationSystem: boolean;
  enhancedMinigames: boolean;
  eraProgression: boolean;
  arDepartment: boolean;
}

// Modular Loading
interface ModuleLoader {
  loadModule(name: string): Promise<GameModule>;
  unloadModule(name: string): void;
  getLoadedModules(): GameModule[];
}
```
