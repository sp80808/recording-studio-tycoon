# Comprehensive Plan for Unity 6 Upgrade

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for the further development and optimization of the "Recording Studio Tycoon" project, specifically targeting Unity 6.

### 1. Key Development Areas

*   **Core System Rebuild & Migration:** The highest priority is to complete the C# rebuild of all remaining game systems within Unity. This includes the Save System, Audio System, Minigame System, Progression System, Staff Management, Project Management, Reward System, Charts & Market System, Dynamic Market Trends, Reputation & Relationship Management, and Studio Perks & Specializations.
*   **Unity 6 Feature Adoption:** Actively investigate and integrate new Unity 6 features to enhance performance, graphics, and overall gameplay. This includes:
    *   **Performance:** Leveraging the Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) (ECS, Burst Compiler, C# Job System) for suitable systems requiring high performance (e.g., complex market simulations, large-scale data processing).
    *   **Graphics:** Migrating to Universal Render Pipeline (URP) or High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for improved visual fidelity, and exploring features like Adaptive Probe Volumes and GPU Resident Drawer.
    *   **AI:** Utilizing Unity Muse and Unity Sentis for more sophisticated AI behaviors, such as dynamic NPC interactions, advanced market prediction, and adaptive challenges.
*   **UI/UX Completion & Refinement:** Finalize the full UI integration using Unity's native UI systems (UGUI or UI Toolkit). Focus on ensuring responsiveness across different resolutions, implementing accessibility features, and delivering a polished, intuitive user experience with smooth animations and visual feedback.
*   **Cloud Integration & Robust Save System:** Implement the comprehensive cloud save functionality as outlined in the Product Requirement Document. This involves utilizing C# SDKs for chosen cloud providers (e.g., Firebase, PlayFab) to support multiple save slots, versioning, auto-save, encryption, cross-device synchronization, data compression, incremental saves, and export/import capabilities.
*   **Legacy Issue Resolution:** Systematically identify and replace all remaining legacy web-based file interactions with native Unity C# solutions to ensure stability and performance.

### 2. Optimization Strategies

*   **Performance Profiling:** Establish a routine for continuous performance profiling using Unity's built-in Profiler. This will help identify and address bottlenecks related to CPU, GPU, memory, and physics in real-time.
*   **Rendering Optimization:** Implement GPU instancing for repetitive game objects (e.g., studio equipment, crowd elements) and utilize static/dynamic batching to reduce draw calls.
*   **Asset Optimization:** Optimize all game assets by compressing textures, simplifying meshes, and using appropriate import settings. Implement Unity Addressables for efficient asset loading and unloading, especially for larger assets or dynamically loaded content.
*   **C# Code Optimization:**
    *   **Parallel Computing:** Employ the C# Job System and Burst Compiler for parallelizing computationally intensive tasks, such as complex market trend calculations, minigame logic, or AI pathfinding.
    *   **Object Pooling:** Implement object pooling for frequently instantiated objects (e.g., UI elements, particle effects, minigame components) to minimize garbage collection overhead.
    *   **Efficient Scripting:** Minimize expensive operations like `FindObjectOfType` and `GetComponent` calls within `Update` loops. Optimize data access patterns and leverage `ScriptableObject` for efficient data management.
*   **UI Optimization:** Optimize UI canvases by reducing overdraw, using appropriate rendering modes, and leveraging the performance benefits of UI Toolkit where applicable.

### 3. Migration Approach

*   **Systematic C# Rebuild:** Continue the current strategy of rebuilding each game system in C# within the Unity environment. This ensures a clean, native implementation that fully leverages Unity's capabilities.
*   **Modular Integration:** Each newly rebuilt C# system will be designed for modularity, ensuring seamless integration with the central `GameManager` and `GameState` architecture. This promotes maintainability and reduces interdependencies.
*   **Data Migration Strategy:** Develop a robust strategy for migrating any existing game data from the legacy web version into Unity's ScriptableObjects and custom C# data structures. This may involve creating custom serialization and deserialization tools.
*   **Incremental UI Migration:** Prioritize the migration of core UI elements and gameplay screens first, followed by secondary panels, modals, and less critical UI components. This allows for continuous testing and iteration.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implement comprehensive automated tests using the Unity Test Framework for each migrated or rebuilt system. This is crucial for ensuring functional correctness and preventing regressions throughout the migration process.

### 4. Addressing Known Issues (Legacy Web-based File Interactions)

*   **Identify and Replace:** Conduct a thorough audit to identify all remaining instances of legacy web-based file interactions (e.g., previous Supabase integration for saves, any direct browser file APIs).
*   **Native Unity File I/O:** Replace these interactions with Unity's native file I/O capabilities. For local storage, utilize `Application.persistentDataPath` along with standard C# file operations (`File.WriteAllBytes`, `File.ReadAllBytes`).
*   **Cloud Save SDKs:** For cloud integration, fully transition to the C# SDKs provided by the chosen cloud services (Firebase, PlayFab). This will handle all save/load operations securely and robustly, eliminating any reliance on web-based file interactions for persistence.
*   **Standardized Data Serialization:** Ensure all game state and data are serialized using Unity's built-in JSON utility or a custom C# serializer (e.g., BinaryFormatter, Protobuf-net) for consistent and efficient saving and loading.

### 5. Phased Rollout

To minimize disruption and manage complexity, a phased approach is recommended:

*   **Phase 1: Core Game Loop & Essential Systems (Current Focus)**
    *   Complete the C# rebuild of `GameManager`, `GameState`, and fundamental game mechanics.
    *   Implement essential UI elements (HUD, main menus, basic interaction flows).
    *   Establish a functional local save/load system using native Unity file I/O.
    *   Address and replace all critical legacy web-based file interaction issues.
*   **Phase 2: System Migration & Integration**
    *   Systematically migrate and integrate remaining core game systems (Minigames, Progression, Staff, Project, Reward, Charts & Market, etc.) into the C# Unity environment.
    *   Implement the full cloud save system using C# SDKs.
    *   Complete the integration of all UI elements with their respective C# game logic.
*   **Phase 3: Optimization & Advanced Features**
    *   Focus on comprehensive performance optimization, leveraging Unity 6's advanced features (DOTS, URP/HDRP).
    *   Integrate advanced AI features (Unity Muse/Sentis) to enhance gameplay depth.
    *   Refine the overall UI/UX for maximum polish, accessibility, and user engagement.
    *   Implement expanded content (new locations, events) and explore future considerations like multiplayer, VR support, and mobile platform optimization.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement automated build and testing pipelines throughout all phases to ensure continuous stability, early detection of issues, and streamlined deployment.
