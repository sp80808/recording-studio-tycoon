# Music Generation Prompts for Chart Tracks

This document contains a comprehensive list of prompts for generating short example music clips to be used as playable tracks in the in-game charts. These clips will add an interactive audio layer to the gameplay, allowing players to click and play chart tracks. Each clip should be 10-20 seconds long to save on storage while still providing a representative musical sample.

## üéµ Planning: How Many Clips Do We Need?

- **Charts System**: The in-game charts typically display a Top 10 or Top 20 each week.
- **Genres**: The game features a variety of genres (e.g., Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, Electronic, Jazz, Country, R&B, Indie, Classical, etc.).
- **Eras**: There are 4 main eras (Analog 60s, Digital 80s, Internet 2000s, Streaming 2020s), each with distinct musical styles.
- **Variety**: To avoid repetition, each genre/era combo should have at least 2-3 unique clips.

### Calculation Example
- 10 genres √ó 4 eras √ó 3 variations = **120 clips** (minimum)
- For a richer experience, aim for 5 variations per genre/era: 10 √ó 4 √ó 5 = **200 clips**

## üìã Prompt List Structure
- **Filename**: `era_genre_variation.mp3` (e.g., `80s_pop_01.mp3`)
- **Prompt**: Text prompt for music generation
- **Tags**: Era, genre, mood, tempo, instruments

## üìÇ Audio Directory Structure

Create the following folder for generated audio clips:

```
/workspaces/recording-studio-tycoon/src/audio/chart_clips/
```

All generated chart track clips should be saved here, named as per the filename convention above.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

1. **Generate Audio Clips**
   - Use the prompts above with a music generation tool (e.g., Suno, AIVA, Boomy, etc.)
   - Export each clip as a 10-20 second MP3, named as per the convention
   - Save all clips in `src/audio/chart_clips/`
2. **Integrate with Game**
   - Update the charts system to associate each chart entry with a genre, era, and audio clip filename
   - Add a play button to each chart entry in the UI
   - On click, play the corresponding audio clip from `src/audio/chart_clips/`
   - Optionally, show a waveform or playback animation
3. **Fallback Handling**
   - If a chart entry has no audio, show a disabled play button or a placeholder sound
4. **Performance & Storage**
   - Keep clips short (10-20s) to minimize storage and bandwidth
   - Consider lazy-loading audio files as needed
5. **Future Expansion**
   - Add more variations per genre/era as the game grows
   - Allow for user-submitted or procedurally generated tracks in the future

*This plan ensures a scalable, immersive audio layer for the charts system, enhancing player engagement and historical authenticity.*
