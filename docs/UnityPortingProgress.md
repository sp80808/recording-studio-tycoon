# Unity Porting Progress

## Date: 18/06/2025

### Step 1: Initial Core Components Porting
- **Completed Components:**
  - Core application structure with `App.cs` mirroring `App.tsx`.
  - Settings management with `SettingsManager.cs` reflecting `SettingsContext`.
  - Save system with `SaveSystem.cs` mirroring `SaveSystemContext`.
  - UI management with `UIManager.cs` for UI elements.
  - Game logic management with `GameManager.cs` for game state control.
- **Status:** These foundational elements have been successfully ported to establish the basic framework in Unity. Existing data models and scriptable objects were not rewritten to avoid duplication.

### Step 2: Identification of Unported Functionality
- **Unported Areas from 'src/' Directory:**
  - `audio/` directory for audio assets and scripts.
  - `components/` directory for UI components.
  - `contexts/` directory for additional state management.
  - `data/` directory for static data.
  - `hooks/` directory for custom logic hooks.
  - `integrations/` directory for external services.
  - `lib/` directory for utility libraries.
  - `pages/` directory for game screens.
  - `providers/` directory for dependency injection.
  - `reducers/` directory for state management logic.
  - `services/` directory for backend interactions.
  - `styles/` directory for styling.
  - `types/` directory for type definitions.
  - `unity_poc_components/` directory for Unity-specific components.
  - `utils/` directory for utility functions.
  - Individual files like `index.css`, `main.tsx`, `setupTests.ts`, and `vite-env.d.ts`.
- **Status:** These areas remain to be localized. The focus will be on translating functionality without altering already implemented components.

### Step 3: Localization System Porting
- **Completed Component:**
  - Localization system with `LocalizationManager.cs` mirroring `i18n.ts` for multi-language support.
- **Status:** Implemented to handle language detection, translation loading, and application, supporting English and Polish as in the original React codebase.

### Step 4: Duplicate File Resolution
- **Action Taken:**
  - Identified and deleted the duplicate `Equipment.cs` file at the root of `DataModels` directory, retaining the version in the `Equipment` subdirectory for better organization.
- **Status:** Resolved duplication to maintain a clean codebase structure.

### Step 5: Next Steps for Porting
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Translate UI components from `components/` and `pages/` into Unity UI prefabs and scripts under `Assets/UI/`.
  - Port utility functions from `utils/` to `Scripts/Utils/`.
  - Integrate audio assets from `audio/` into `Assets/Audio/`.
  - Ensure no overlap with existing implementations by reviewing current files before creating new ones.
- **Documentation Update:** This markdown will be updated after each significant porting step to reflect progress and plans.

### Notes:
- Care is being taken to avoid destructive changes or rewriting of sorted files unless adding unported functionality.
- Further investigation for other potential duplicates will be conducted in subsequent steps to ensure a clean codebase structure.
