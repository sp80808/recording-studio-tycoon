## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Communication State Management
```typescript
interface CommunicationState {
  contacts: ContactEntry[];
  conversations: Conversation[];
  relationships: RelationshipData[];
  notifications: EnhancedNotification[];
  events: IndustryEvent[];
}
```

#### 2. Network Effect Calculations
- **Reputation scoring algorithm**
- **Contact availability matrices**
- **Influence propagation system**

#### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Communication events**: Message sent/received, relationship changes
- **Industry events**: Market shifts, trend changes, opportunity windows
- **Player events**: Achievement unlocks, milestone completions

### Component Structure

#### New Components Needed
1. **CommunicationHub** - Main communication interface
2. **ContactManager** - Contact organization and relationship tracking
3. **NetworkingPanel** - Industry events and opportunities
4. **CollaborationManager** - Multi-artist project coordination
5. **ReputationDashboard** - Industry standing and influence metrics
6. **EventCalendar** - Upcoming events and scheduling
7. **NegotiationInterface** - Contract and deal negotiation UI

#### Enhanced Existing Components
1. **ChartsPanel** - Integration with enhanced artist contact system
2. **NotificationSystem** - Communication-aware notifications
3. **GameState** - Extended with communication and networking data
