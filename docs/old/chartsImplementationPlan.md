# Charts System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the steps required to implement the basic charts system, artist contact system, and market analysis tools for Recording Studio Tycoon.

## 1. Basic Charts System

### 1.1. Data Structures

- Review and refine the existing `Chart`, `ChartEntry`, `Artist`, and `Song` interfaces in `src/types/charts.ts`.
- Ensure that these interfaces include all the necessary properties for chart generation, display, and interaction.

### 1.2. Chart Generation

- Review and refine the existing `generateCharts` function in `src/data/chartsData.ts`.
- Implement logic to generate realistic chart data based on the current game era, player level, and other factors.
- Ensure that the chart data includes a variety of genres and artists.

### 1.3. Chart Display

- Create a new UI component called `ChartsPanel` to display the chart data.
- This component should allow players to view different charts, filter by genre, and sort by position.
- Implement a `ChartEntry` component to display individual chart entries.

### 1.4. Chart Updates

- Implement logic to update the charts on a weekly basis.
- This should involve generating new chart data and updating the UI.
- Consider using a timer or event system to trigger the chart updates.

## 2. Artist Contact System

### 2.1. Artist Database

- Review and refine the existing `generateArtist` function in `src/data/chartsData.ts`.
- Ensure that the artist data includes all the necessary properties for contact and collaboration.
- Consider storing the artist data in a separate file or database.

### 2.2. Contact Mechanics

- Implement logic to allow players to contact artists based on their chart position and other factors.
- Use the existing `calculateContactCost` and `calculateContactSuccess` functions in `src/data/chartsData.ts` to determine the cost and probability of success.
- Implement a UI component to display the contact cost and success probability.

### 2.3. Response Time Simulation

- Implement logic to simulate a response time from the artist.
- This could involve using a timer or event system to delay the response.
- Implement a UI component to display the response time.

## 3. Market Analysis Tools

### 3.1. Trend Analysis

- Review and refine the existing `generateMarketTrends` function in `src/data/chartsData.ts`.
- Implement logic to track genre popularity, identify seasonal trends, and predict future trends.
- Consider using historical data to improve the accuracy of the trend analysis.

### 3.2. Trend Display

- Create a new UI component to display the market trends.
- This component should allow players to view the popularity, growth, and seasonality of different genres.
- Consider using charts or graphs to visualize the trend data.

## 4. Integration and Testing

### 4.1. Integrate the charts system with the existing game.
### 4.2. Test the charts system thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
### 4.3. Balance the charts system to ensure that it is challenging but not too difficult.

## 5. UI/UX Refinement

### 5.1. Refine the UI/UX of the charts system based on player feedback.
### 5.2. Add tooltips and other helpful information to the UI.
### 5.3. Ensure that the charts system is accessible to all players.
