# Current Development Task - Recording Studio Tycoon
*Updated: June 9, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Focus: Bug Fixes & System Integration (Phase 2B)

### ✅ Recently Completed (Today - June 9)
1. **Fixed Duplicate Notification Issue** - Critical UI/UX improvement
   - **Problem**: Equipment purchase triggered both white notification bubble AND green toast
   - **Solution**: Removed `addNotification()` call, kept only green toast for consistency
   - **File**: `/src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx` lines 123-129 removed
   - **Impact**: Cleaner, more consistent user experience across all purchase actions

2. **Version Update** - Project maintenance
   - **Updated**: `package.json` version from 0.3.0 → 0.3.1
   - **Documentation**: Updated progress.md with latest implementation status
   - **Status**: Ready for next development phase

3. **Fixed Project Completion Screen Timing** - Ensured celebration screen appears immediately after project work completion and before the next project/review modal.
   - **Problem**: Project completion celebration was delayed or misaligned with actual project finalization.
   - **Solution**: Refactored `ActiveProject.tsx` to correctly sequence the celebration animation and the `onProjectComplete` callback. The `ProjectCompletionCelebration` component now controls invoking the final completion logic.
   - **File**: `/workspaces/recording-studio-tycoon/src/components/ActiveProject.tsx`

- [ ] Ensure minigame rewards integrate properly with main game progression

#### 2. Polish & Enhancement (Medium Priority)  
- [ ] Add sound effects for minigame interactions
- [ ] Implement visual polish (animations, transitions)
- [ ] Add tutorial hints for new minigames
- [ ] Create genre-specific variations for existing parameters

#### 3. Advanced Systems Implementation (Next Phase)
- [ ] Implement Era-based progression system

| Beat Making | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Mixing Board | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Mastering | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Vocal Recording | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Rhythm Timing | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| **Effect Chain** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** |
| **Acoustic Treatment** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** |
| **Instrument Layering** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** |

### 📊 Technical Implementation Notes

#### Minigame Trigger Conditions
- **Effect Chain**: Production stages, effects processing, layering focus ≥40%
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Setup stages, acoustic projects, player level ≥5
- **Instrument Layering**: Arrangement stages, orchestration, layering focus ≥60%

#### Scoring Systems  
- **Effect Chain**: Accuracy + efficiency (creativity/8, technical/10)
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Budget optimization (creativity/12, technical/8)  
- **Instrument Layering**: Frequency balance (creativity/9, technical/11)

#### Focus Area Compatibility
All new minigames use valid FocusAllocation fields:
- `performance`: Used for rhythm-based challenges
- `soundCapture`: Used for recording quality challenges  
- `layering`: Used for arrangement and mixing challenges

### 🎯 Current Project Status (Phase Assessment)

#### Implementation Roadmap Progress
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete (Core mechanics, basic minigames)
- **Phase 2A**: ✅ Complete (Advanced minigames - fully implemented)
- **Phase 2B**: ✅ 90% Complete (Charts system, artist networking - mostly done)
- **Phase 3**: 📅 Planning Stage (Communication layer, networking systems)

#### Enhanced Minigames Documentation Compliance
Following `/docs/ENHANCED_MINIGAMES_DETAILED.md`:
- ✅ Effect chain building (Section 3.2) - Fully implemented
- ✅ Acoustic treatment puzzle (Section 3.5) - Fully implemented
- ✅ Instrument layering challenge (Section 3.3) - Fully implemented
- 📅 Era-specific mechanics (Section 4) - Planned for Phase 3

### 🚀 Immediate Priorities (Next Development Session)

#### 1. System Integration Testing
- [ ] **Cross-system verification**: Test charts + minigames + equipment interactions
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Monitor heavy component loading and modal interactions
- [ ] **Data flow validation**: Ensure all state management systems work cohesively

#### 2. Technical Debt & Optimization
- [ ] **Large component decomposition**: Break down 500+ line components (ChartsPanel.tsx, EquipmentDetailModal.tsx)
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness**: Test drag-and-drop interfaces on touch devices
- [ ] **Loading optimization**: Implement lazy loading for heavy modal components

#### 3. Phase 3 Planning & Architecture
- [ ] **Communication layer design**: Plan artist interaction and networking systems
- [ ] **Multiplayer foundation**: Design client-server architecture patterns
- [ ] **Social features**: Plan leaderboards, sharing, and community features

### 🐛 Known Issues & Testing Priorities
