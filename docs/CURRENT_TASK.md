# Current Development Task - Recording Studio Tycoon
*Updated: June 8, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Focus: Advanced Minigames Implementation (Phase 2A)

### ✅ Recently Completed (Today)
1. **Created EffectChainGame.tsx** - Advanced effect chain building minigame

   - Drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback
   - Parameter visualization and scoring system
   - File: `/src/components/minigames/EffectChainGame.tsx`

2. **Created AcousticTreatmentGame.tsx** - Room optimization puzzle
   - 8x6 grid placement system with budget constraints
   - 4 treatment types (absorber, diffuser, bass-trap, reflection-filter)
   - Recording type optimization mechanics
   - File: `/src/components/minigames/AcousticTreatmentGame.tsx`

3. **Created InstrumentLayeringGame.tsx** - Advanced arrangement challenge
   - Frequency conflict detection system
   - Timing, volume, and panning controls
   - Genre-specific track combinations
   - Real-time mix analysis with visual feedback
   - File: `/src/components/minigames/InstrumentLayeringGame.tsx`

4. **Updated MinigameManager.tsx** - Integration framework
   - Added imports for all new minigames
   - Updated MinigameType to include 'effectchain', 'acoustic', 'layering'
   - Implemented scoring systems for new games
   - File: `/src/components/minigames/MinigameManager.tsx`

5. **Enhanced minigameUtils.ts** - Trigger system expansion
   - Added trigger logic for effect chain building
   - Added acoustic treatment triggers
   - Added instrument layering triggers with genre-specific conditions
   - Fixed focus allocation compatibility issues
   - File: `/src/utils/minigameUtils.ts`

### 🚧 Next Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

#### 1. Testing & Integration (High Priority)
- [ ] Test new minigames in-game to ensure proper triggering
- [ ] Verify scoring systems work correctly
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop interfaces on different screen sizes
- [ ] Ensure minigame rewards integrate properly with main game progression

#### 2. Polish & Enhancement (Medium Priority)  
- [ ] Add sound effects for minigame interactions
- [ ] Implement visual polish (animations, transitions)
- [ ] Add tutorial hints for new minigames
- [ ] Create genre-specific variations for existing parameters

#### 3. Advanced Systems Implementation (Next Phase)
- [ ] Implement Era-based progression system
- [ ] Add A&R Department basic structure
- [ ] Create Charts system foundation
- [ ] Implement Communication/EPK system basics

### 🎮 Current Minigame Suite Status

| Minigame | Status | Triggers | Integration |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Beat Making | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Mixing Board | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Mastering | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Vocal Recording | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| Rhythm Timing | ✅ Complete | ✅ Working | ✅ Integrated |
| **Effect Chain** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** |
| **Acoustic Treatment** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** |
| **Instrument Layering** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** |

### 📊 Technical Implementation Notes

#### Minigame Trigger Conditions
- **Effect Chain**: Production stages, effects processing, layering focus ≥40%
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Setup stages, acoustic projects, player level ≥5
- **Instrument Layering**: Arrangement stages, orchestration, layering focus ≥60%

#### Scoring Systems  
- **Effect Chain**: Accuracy + efficiency (creativity/8, technical/10)
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Budget optimization (creativity/12, technical/8)  
- **Instrument Layering**: Frequency balance (creativity/9, technical/11)

#### Focus Area Compatibility
All new minigames use valid FocusAllocation fields:
- `performance`: Used for rhythm-based challenges
- `soundCapture`: Used for recording quality challenges  
- `layering`: Used for arrangement and mixing challenges

### 🎯 Alignment with Documentation

#### Implementation Roadmap Progress
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete (Core mechanics, basic minigames)
- **Phase 2A**: 🚧 In Progress (Advanced minigames - nearly complete)
- **Phase 2B**: 📅 Next (Charts system, artist networking)

#### Enhanced Minigames Documentation Compliance
Following `/docs/ENHANCED_MINIGAMES_DETAILED.md`:
- ✅ Effect chain building (Section 3.2)
- ✅ Acoustic treatment puzzle (Section 3.5) 
- ✅ Instrument layering challenge (Section 3.3)
- 📅 Coming: Era-specific mechanics (Section 4)

### 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness needs testing for drag-and-drop interfaces
- [ ] Performance testing needed for complex visual feedback systems
- [ ] Save compatibility during minigame system expansion
- [ ] Balance testing for scoring and rewards

### 🎵 Integration with Main Game
All new minigames integrate seamlessly with:
- Existing focus allocation system
- Player progression and XP rewards
- Studio equipment bonuses
- Genre-specific project types
- Staff assistance systems
