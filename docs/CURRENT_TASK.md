# Current Development Task - Recording Studio Tycoon
*Updated: June 9, 2025*

## üéØ Current Focus: Bug Fixes & System Integration (Phase 2B)

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (Today - June 9)
1. **Fixed Duplicate Notification Issue** - Critical UI/UX improvement
   - **Problem**: Equipment purchase triggered both white notification bubble AND green toast
   - **Solution**: Removed `addNotification()` call, kept only green toast for consistency
   - **File**: `/src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx` lines 123-129 removed
   - **Impact**: Cleaner, more consistent user experience across all purchase actions

2. **Version Update** - Project maintenance
   - **Updated**: `package.json` version from 0.3.0 ‚Üí 0.3.1
   - **Documentation**: Updated progress.md with latest implementation status
   - **Status**: Ready for next development phase

3. **Fixed Project Completion Screen Timing** - Ensured celebration screen appears immediately after project work completion and before the next project/review modal.
   - **Problem**: Project completion celebration was delayed or misaligned with actual project finalization.
   - **Solution**: Refactored `ActiveProject.tsx` to correctly sequence the celebration animation and the `onProjectComplete` callback. The `ProjectCompletionCelebration` component now controls invoking the final completion logic.
   - **File**: `/workspaces/recording-studio-tycoon/src/components/ActiveProject.tsx`

   - Files: `/src/hooks/useBackgroundMusic.tsx`, `/src/components/SplashScreen.tsx`

### üöß Next Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

#### 1. Testing & Integration (High Priority)
- [ ] Test new minigames in-game to ensure proper triggering
- [ ] Verify scoring systems work correctly
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop interfaces on different screen sizes
- [ ] Ensure minigame rewards integrate properly with main game progression

#### 2. Polish & Enhancement (Medium Priority)  
- [ ] Add sound effects for minigame interactions
- [ ] Implement visual polish (animations, transitions)
- [ ] Add tutorial hints for new minigames
- [ ] Create genre-specific variations for existing parameters

#### 3. Advanced Systems Implementation (Next Phase)
- [ ] Implement Era-based progression system
- [ ] Add A&R Department basic structure
- [ ] Create Charts system foundation
- [ ] Implement Communication/EPK system basics

### üéÆ Current Minigame Suite Status

### üìä Technical Implementation Notes

#### Minigame Trigger Conditions
- **Effect Chain**: Production stages, effects processing, layering focus ‚â•40%
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Setup stages, acoustic projects, player level ‚â•5
- **Instrument Layering**: Arrangement stages, orchestration, layering focus ‚â•60%

#### Scoring Systems  
- **Effect Chain**: Accuracy + efficiency (creativity/8, technical/10)
- **Acoustic Treatment**: Budget optimization (creativity/12, technical/8)  
- **Instrument Layering**: Frequency balance (creativity/9, technical/11)

#### Focus Area Compatibility
All new minigames use valid FocusAllocation fields:
- `performance`: Used for rhythm-based challenges
- `soundCapture`: Used for recording quality challenges  
- `layering`: Used for arrangement and mixing challenges

### üéØ Current Project Status (Phase Assessment)

Following `/docs/ENHANCED_MINIGAMES_DETAILED.md`:
- ‚úÖ Effect chain building (Section 3.2) - Fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Acoustic treatment puzzle (Section 3.5) - Fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Instrument layering challenge (Section 3.3) - Fully implemented
- üìÖ Era-specific mechanics (Section 4) - Planned for Phase 3

### üöÄ Immediate Priorities (Next Development Session)

#### 1. System Integration Testing
