# Progression System Implementation

## Overview

The progression system in Recording Studio Tycoon consists of several interconnected components that work together to create a deep and engaging player experience:

1. Core Attributes & Effects
2. Milestone System
3. Feature Unlocks
4. Critical Success System
5. Skill Development

## Core Systems

### Attributes & Effects

The system calculates various effects based on player attributes:
- Creativity: Influences song quality and innovation
- Technical: Reduces equipment maintenance and improves recording quality
- Charisma: Influences client satisfaction and staff morale
- Business: Affects contract negotiations and marketing effectiveness
- Luck: Affects random events and critical successes

Effects are calculated using the `calculateAttributeEffects` function in `progressionUtils.ts`, which applies appropriate modifiers based on attribute levels.

### Milestone System

Milestones are defined in `data/milestones.ts` and provide rewards at specific level thresholds:
- New project types and opportunities
- Equipment upgrades
- Staff training options
- Attribute and perk points
- Feature unlocks

### Feature Management

The feature system (`featureUtils.ts`) manages unlockable content with:
- Level-based requirements
- Prerequisite chains
- Category organization
- Unlock validation

Categories include:
- Project Types
- Equipment
- Staff Features
- Training Courses
- Techniques
- Minigames

### Critical Success System

Critical successes provide bonus rewards based on the player's luck attribute:
- Base 5% chance per luck point
- 50% bonus to all rewards on critical success
- Affects quality, payout, and experience gains

### Key Components

1. **ProgressionUtils**
   - Attribute effect calculations
   - Skill development tracking
   - Critical success checks
   - Milestone reward application

2. **FeatureUtils**
   - Feature availability checks
   - Prerequisite validation
   - Category management
   - Unlock state tracking

3. **ProgressionPanel**
   - Attribute display and upgrades
   - Milestone progress tracking
   - Skill development interface
   - Visual feedback for unlocks

## Integration Points

### Project System
- Quality calculations incorporate attribute effects
- Critical success chance from luck attribute
- Feature requirements for project types

### Staff System
- Training options unlocked through milestones
- Staff effectiveness modified by player attributes
- Mentorship system requirements

### Equipment System
- Unlock requirements tied to level progression
- Efficiency bonuses from technical attributes
- Maintenance costs affected by attributes

## Usage Examples

### Checking Feature Availability
```typescript
// Check if a feature can be used
if (isFeatureUnlocked(gameState, 'advanced_mixing')) {
  // Allow access to advanced mixing features
}

// Get next available features
const nextFeatures = getNextAvailableFeatures(gameState);
```

### Applying Critical Success
```typescript
// Check for critical success
if (checkCriticalSuccess(effects.criticalSuccessChance)) {
  result = applyCriticalSuccess(result);
}
```

### Milestone Management
```typescript
// Apply milestone rewards
const updatedState = applyMilestoneRewards(gameState, milestone);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Difficulty**
   - Adjust project difficulty based on player progression
   - Scale rewards based on player level and attributes

2. **Specialization Paths**
   - Genre-specific progression trees
   - Technical vs. Creative focus options

3. **Achievement System**
   - Tie into milestone system
   - Provide additional rewards and goals

4. **Perk System Expansion**
   - Additional perk types
   - Perk combinations and synergies

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. Keep milestone rewards balanced
2. Test feature prerequisites thoroughly
3. Monitor attribute effect scaling
4. Update documentation when adding features
5. Consider progression speed when adjusting values
