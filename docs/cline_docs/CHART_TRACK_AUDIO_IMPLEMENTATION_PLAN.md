# Chart Track Audio Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps for integrating short, genre- and era-specific music clips into the in-game charts system, allowing players to play audio samples for each chart entry.

---

## 1. Audio Asset Generation
- Use the prompts in `CHART_TRACK_AUDIO_PROMPTS.md` to generate 10-20s MP3 clips for each genre/era/variation.
- Name files as `era_genre_variation.mp3` (e.g., `80s_pop_01.mp3`).
- Save all files in `src/audio/chart_clips/`.

## 2. Directory Structure
- Ensure the following directory exists:
  - `src/audio/chart_clips/`

## 3. Game Integration
- Update the chart data model to include `audioClip` property (filename).
- When rendering the charts UI, display a play button for each entry with an audio clip.
- On click, play the corresponding audio file from `src/audio/chart_clips/`.
- If no audio is available, show a disabled button or placeholder sound.

## 4. UI/UX
- Add a play/pause button to each chart entry row.
- Optionally, display a waveform or progress bar during playback.
- Ensure only one track plays at a time.

## 5. Performance & Storage
- Keep clips short (10-20s) to minimize storage and bandwidth.
- Lazy-load audio files as needed.

## 6. Testing
- Verify playback works in all supported browsers.
- Test with missing or corrupted files (fallback behavior).

## 7. Future Expansion
- Add more variations per genre/era as needed.
- Consider user-submitted or procedurally generated tracks.

*This plan will add an interactive, historically authentic audio layer to the charts system, increasing immersion and replay value.*
