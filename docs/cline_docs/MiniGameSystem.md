# Minigame Overlay & Animated Stat Rewards Integration (2024-06)

## Overview

- Minigames are now triggered automatically as overlays/modals on the last stage of a project, rather than being listed in the project window.
- Animated stat rewards provide visual feedback for player achievements
- Integration with the project system for contextual challenges
- Era-specific minigame availability based on game progression

## Rationale

This approach streamlines the gameplay loop, reduces UI clutter, and ensures that minigames are a focused, rewarding part of project completion. Animated stat rewards and overlays enhance player engagement and provide clear, satisfying feedback.

## Implementation Steps

1. Refactor project stage logic to detect the last stage and trigger the relevant minigame overlay/modal automatically.
2. Create a reusable modal/overlay component for minigames, ensuring it blocks the main project UI only when active.
3. Integrate animated stat rewards: on minigame completion, trigger floating blob animations and increment stat numbers.
4. Ensure the 'Complete Stage' button is always visible and accessible.
5. Remove any redundant minigame lists or manual launch buttons from the project window.
6. Playtest and iterate for clarity, fun, and reward.
