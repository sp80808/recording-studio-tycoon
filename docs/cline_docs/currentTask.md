- [x] Updated `projectRoadmap.md` to include Lyric Focus game.

### Implementation (Phase 2)
- [x] Defined TypeScript interfaces for Lyric Focus game (`Keyword`, `Theme`, `LyricFocusGameState` in `src/types/miniGame.ts`).
- [x] Added `'lyricFocus'` to `MinigameType` in `src/types/miniGame.ts`.
- [x] Created data for keywords and themes in `src/data/lyricFocusData.ts`.
- [x] Developed the `LyricFocusGame.tsx` React component.
  - [x] UI for theme display, keyword selection, timer, score.
  - [x] Gameplay logic (keyword pool generation, selection handling, scoring).
- [x] Integrated with `MinigameManager.tsx`.
- [x] Added `minigameTriggerId: 'lyricFocus'` to relevant `ProjectStage` templates in `src/data/projectTemplates.ts`.
- [x] Updated `src/components/minigames/index.ts` to export the new game.
- [x] Updated `minigameTutorials` in `src/components/minigames/index.ts` with tutorial content for Lyric Focus.

### Post-Implementation (Phase 3)
- [ ] Test Lyric Focus minigame functionality thoroughly. (User task)
- [ ] Balance scoring and difficulty. (User task)
- [x] Updated `codebaseSummary.md` with details of the new minigame component and types.

## Current Focus: Phase 2 Enhancements (As per original prompt)

### 1. Dynamic Market Trends & Sub-Genre Evolution
- [x] Define `MarketTrend` Interface (genreId, subGenreId, popularity, trendDirection) - Verified in `src/types/charts.ts`
- [x] Define `SubGenre` structure and association with main Genres - Verified in `src/types/charts.ts`
- [x] Create `MarketService` (`src/services/marketService.ts`) - Initial structure and mock data created. (16/06/2025)
  - [ ] Logic for periodic `MarketTrend` updates (time, player releases, global events) - Basic placeholder logic implemented. (16/06/2025)
  - [x] Methods to query current popularity for Genre/SubGenre combinations - Implemented. (16/06/2025)
- [x] Integration with Projects & Charts (16/06/2025)
  - [x] Modify Appeal/ChartScore of `OriginalMusicProject` releases based on trends - Implemented in `src/utils/bandUtils.ts` (`calculateReviewScore`).
  - [x] Influence `ContractProject` value based on trends - Implemented in `src/utils/projectUtils.ts` (`generateNewProjects` payout calculation).
- [x] Conceptualize UI Feedback (e.g., "Music Industry Report" component, `useMarketTrends` hook). - Initial `MusicIndustryReport.tsx` component created. `useMarketTrends` hook needs review/integration. (16/06/2025)

### 2. Reputation & Relationship Management (Clients/Artists/Labels)
- [x] Define `Client` / `RecordLabel` Interfaces (id, name, relationshipScore, preferredGenres/Moods) - Created in `src/types/relationships.ts`. (16/06/2025)
- [x] Create `RelationshipService` (`src/services/relationshipService.ts`) - Initial structure created. (16/06/2025)
  - [x] Manage `relationshipScore` for all Client and RecordLabel entities - Basic storage and retrieval in place. (16/06/2025)
  - [x] Methods for `increaseRelationship(entityId, amount, reason)` and `decreaseRelationship(entityId, amount, reason)` - Implemented. (16/06/2025)
  - [ ] Logic to trigger these updates based on Project completion (quality, timeliness), `OriginalMusicProject` success (if the label is involved), or player-initiated "favors." - Placeholder logic for project completion added; needs refinement and integration. Player favors TBD.
- [-] Tiered Contract Generation (Initial implementation for payout/rep modification)
  - [x] Modify `ContractGenerationService` (i.e., `generateNewProjects` in `src/utils/projectUtils.ts`) to simulate influence of relationshipScore on contract value/rep for certain client types. (16/06/2025)
  - [ ] Further refine to source projects from specific entities based on relationship.
- [ ] Consequences of Low Relationship (blacklisting, negative PR events).

### 3. Studio Perks & Specializations
- [x] Define `StudioPerk` Interface (id, name, description, category, unlockConditions, effects) - Created in `src/types/studioPerks.ts`. (16/06/2025)
- [x] Create `StudioUpgradeService` (`src/services/studioUpgradeService.ts`) - Initial structure created. (16/06/2025)
  - [x] Manage available and unlocked perks - Basic logic for `getAvailablePerks`, `canUnlockPerk`, `unlockPerk`, `getOwnedPerks` implemented. (16/06/2025)
  - [ ] Logic for applying perk effects to game state - Conceptual `applyAllPerkEffects` implemented; needs integration with actual game systems.
  - [ ] UI for perk tree/list (conceptual).

## Next Steps
1.  Refine `MarketService` logic for periodic `MarketTrend` updates.
2.  Integrate `useMarketTrends` hook with `MusicIndustryReport.tsx` and other UI elements.
3.  Refine `RelationshipService` logic for triggering updates and integrate with game events.
4.  Develop logic for applying perk effects in `StudioUpgradeService` and integrate with game systems.
5.  Conceptualize UI for perk tree/list.
