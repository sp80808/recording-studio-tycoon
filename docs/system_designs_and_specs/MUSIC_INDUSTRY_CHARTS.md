# Music Industry Charts & Networking System
*Recording Studio Tycoon - Charts Integration*

## Overview
The Charts System transforms the game from an isolated studio experience into a dynamic music industry simulation where players interact with real market trends and industry professionals.

## Core Features

### 1. Dynamic Music Charts
```typescript
interface Chart {
  id: string;
  name: string; // "Billboard Hot 100", "Country Charts", etc.
  entries: ChartEntry[];
  genre: MusicGenre;
  updateFrequency: number; // days
  influence: number; // industry importance
}

interface ChartEntry {
  position: number;
  artist: Artist;
  song: Song;
  movement: 'up' | 'down' | 'new' | 'steady';
  weeksOnChart: number;
  peakPosition: number;
}
```

### 2. Artist Contact System
- **Reputation Gates**: Different artists require minimum reputation levels
- **Project Availability**: Artists have current project needs
- **Response Times**: Realistic 1-3 day communication delays
- **Success Rates**: Based on player reputation and artist status

### 3. Market Trend Analysis
```typescript
interface MarketTrend {
  genre: MusicGenre;
  popularity: number; // 0-100
  growth: number; // positive/negative trend
  seasonality: number[]; // monthly variations
  events: TrendEvent[]; // special occurrences
}
```

```
