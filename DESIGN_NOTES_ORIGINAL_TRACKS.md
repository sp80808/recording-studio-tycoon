# ORIGINAL TRACKS FEATURE - Strategic Planning Document

## Overview
The "Original Tracks" feature introduces a second gameplay path alongside contract work, inspired by Game Dev Tycoon. Players can create and release their own music, transitioning from being a hired studio to becoming an independent artist/label.

## Core Concept
**Unlock Condition:** Player Level 5
- New UI element "Create Original Track" appears in Daily Actions panel
- Represents the studio's evolution from client work to original content creation

## Creation Process

### 1. Genre & Direction Selection
**Genre Selection:**
- Player chooses from genres they have experience in (Studio Skill Level > 1)
- Available sub-genres unlock based on equipment and staff expertise
- Each genre has different market appeal and complexity factors

**Creative Direction Sliders:**
- **Catchiness vs. Complexity:** Affects mainstream appeal vs. critical reception
- **Mainstream Appeal vs. Niche Sound:** Determines target audience size
- **Production Value vs. Raw Authenticity:** Influences required budget and equipment

### 2. Budget Allocation System
**Production Budget:**
- Affects quality ceiling and available equipment/staff bonuses
- Higher budgets unlock advanced production techniques
- Can hire session musicians or rent premium equipment

**Marketing Budget:**
- Determines initial reach and platform placement
- Influences review outlet coverage
- Affects streaming service featuring opportunities

### 3. Development as Active Project
**Progression:**
- Original track becomes an activeProject like contract work
- All existing systems apply (staff, equipment, focus allocation)
- Stages adapt to chosen direction (e.g., "Songwriting," "Demo Recording," "Full Production," "Marketing Prep")

**Quality Factors:**
- C/T points accumulation determines final track quality
- Player choices during development affect different aspects
- Equipment and staff expertise influence genre-specific bonuses

## Release & Revenue Model

### 1. Review System
**Review Generation:**
- 2-3 simulated reviews from procedurally generated outlets
- Review scores (1-10) based on:
  - Final quality score (40%)
  - Genre fit and market timing (30%)
  - Player reputation (20%)
  - Random factors (10%)

**Review Content:**
- Generated feedback blurbs highlighting strengths/weaknesses
- Comments on production quality, creativity, market fit
- Constructive criticism that hints at improvement areas

### 2. Passive Income Stream
**Revenue Calculation:**
```
Daily Income = (Quality Score × Marketing Multiplier × Genre Popularity × Platform Reach) / Decay Factor
```

**Income Duration:** 20 game days with gradual decay
- Peak performance in days 3-7
- Steady decline afterwards
- Potential for "sleeper hits" with delayed success

**Platform Integration:**
- Different platforms favor different genres
- Streaming vs. sales ratios based on genre and audience
- Social media buzz affects reach multiplier

### 3. Long-term Impact
**Reputation System:**
- Successful releases boost overall studio reputation
- Failed releases can damage reputation if poorly received
- Genre-specific reputation affects future opportunities

**Unlocked Opportunities:**
- High-performing tracks attract better staff candidates
- Record labels may offer distribution deals
- Collaboration requests from other artists
- Festival/venue booking opportunities

## Strategic Depth

### Risk vs. Reward
- Original tracks require upfront investment with uncertain returns
- Contract work provides guaranteed income but limited growth
- Players must balance portfolio between stability and growth

- Player actions influence local music scene
- Successful tracks in a genre increase its popularity
- Oversaturation leads to diminishing returns

### Progression Synergy
