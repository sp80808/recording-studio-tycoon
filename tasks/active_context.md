## Next Steps
1. Continue with detailed planning and architectural design for all new features.
2. Prioritize and break down tasks into actionable sprints based on the updated `tasks/tasks_plan.md`.
3. Regularly review and update all memory documentation as planning and development progresses.
4. Begin implementation of the highest priority features once planning is complete and approved.

## Debugging Session: Fixing Type Errors and File Inconsistencies (12/06/2025)
**Objective**: Resolve TypeScript errors and inconsistencies arising from parallel development streams.

**Files Currently Under Review/Modification**:
- `src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx`: Corrected `handlePerformDailyWork` return type.
- `src/hooks/useGameActions.tsx`: Rewritten to ensure correct imports and `useCallback` usage, and `PerformDailyWorkResult` definition.
- `src/hooks/useStaffManagement.tsx`: Rewritten to ensure correct imports, `SetGameStateFunction` type, and `generateCandidates` import path.
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`: Corrected `MinigameType` import.
- `src/components/MainGameContent.tsx`: Corrected `MinigameType` import and `performDailyWork` prop type.
- `src/components/minigames/MinigameManager.tsx`: Removed problematic imports (`AudioRestorationGame`, `AnalogConsoleGame`) and corresponding `switch` cases, removed duplicate `RhythmTimingGame` import, and other unused imports.
- `src/hooks/useMinigames.ts`: Completed `MINIGAME_REWARDS` object with placeholder reward functions for all `MinigameType` values.
- `src/components/ChartsPanel.tsx`: Removed JSDoc-style comment block causing parsing error.

**Known Issues/Challenges**:
- Persistent "Cannot find module" errors after `write_to_file` operations, suggesting potential caching or file system synchronization issues.
- Inability to run `npm test` due to missing script.
- Discrepancies in file existence (e.g., `AudioRestorationGame.tsx`, `AnalogConsoleGame.tsx`) between `list_files` and `read_file` attempts, indicating active refactoring by other processes.
