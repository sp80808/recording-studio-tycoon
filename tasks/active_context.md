# Current State of Development

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on enhancing core gameplay systems, expanding content, and fleshing out the music industry simulation.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Implemented new minigames and expanded existing ones.
- Added new equipment types and categories.
- Introduced more diverse artists and expanded music genres.
- Enhanced chart generation and market trend simulation.
- Expanded staff candidate pool and roles.
- Refactored `ActiveProject.tsx` for better maintainability and to resolve dependency issues.
- Updated core memory files (`docs/product_requirement_docs.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks_plan.md`) to reflect recent changes.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `src/types/game.ts` and `src/types/miniGame.ts` with new minigame types.
- Added new minigames to `src/data/minigames.ts`.
- Added new equipment to `src/data/equipment.ts`.
- Updated `src/types/charts.ts` with new `MusicGenre` and `Artist` properties.
- Expanded `src/data/artistsData.ts` with more artists.
- Enhanced `src/data/chartsData.ts` with new chart types and logic.
- Updated `src/utils/projectUtils.ts` with new staff candidate names and roles.
- Fixed `src/components/minigames/GuitarPedalBoardGame.tsx` by installing `@dnd-kit` packages and adding missing `icon` property.
- Refactored and fixed `src/components/ActiveProject.tsx` to resolve multiple errors and improve component logic.

## Next Steps
1. Continue with development tasks outlined in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`, focusing on the remaining unchecked items.
2. Regularly review and update documentation as development progresses.
3. Implement player band creation and management.
4. Implement song creation and release mechanics.
5. Integrate player songs into charts.
6. Develop chart progression and influence system.

## Debugging Session: Fixing Type Errors and File Inconsistencies (12/06/2025)
**Objective**: Resolve TypeScript errors and inconsistencies arising from parallel development streams.

**Files Currently Under Review/Modification**:
- `src/hooks/useGameLogic.tsx`: Corrected `handlePerformDailyWork` return type.
- `src/hooks/useGameActions.tsx`: Rewritten to ensure correct imports and `useCallback` usage, and `PerformDailyWorkResult` definition.
- `src/hooks/useStaffManagement.tsx`: Rewritten to ensure correct imports, `SetGameStateFunction` type, and `generateCandidates` import path.
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`: Corrected `MinigameType` import.
- `src/components/MainGameContent.tsx`: Corrected `MinigameType` import and `performDailyWork` prop type.
- `src/components/minigames/MinigameManager.tsx`: Removed problematic imports (`AudioRestorationGame`, `AnalogConsoleGame`) and corresponding `switch` cases, removed duplicate `RhythmTimingGame` import, and other unused imports.
- `src/hooks/useMinigames.ts`: Completed `MINIGAME_REWARDS` object with placeholder reward functions for all `MinigameType` values.
- `src/components/ChartsPanel.tsx`: Removed JSDoc-style comment block causing parsing error.

**Known Issues/Challenges**:
- Persistent "Cannot find module" errors after `write_to_file` operations, suggesting potential caching or file system synchronization issues.
- Inability to run `npm test` due to missing script.
- Discrepancies in file existence (e.g., `AudioRestorationGame.tsx`, `AnalogConsoleGame.tsx`) between `list_files` and `read_file` attempts, indicating active refactoring by other processes.
