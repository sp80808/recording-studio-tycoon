# Current State of Development

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus of development has shifted to a **full rebuild of the game within the Unity engine using C# and native Unity UI**. This strategic decision aims to leverage Unity's native capabilities for enhanced flexibility, performance, and a more robust game development experience, moving beyond the previous web-based game engine and ReactUnity.

## Key Progress on Full Unity Rebuild (C#)
-   **Core Game Logic Rebuilt**: The fundamental `GameManager.cs` and `GameState.cs` have been successfully rebuilt in C#. This includes the initial structure and basic game loop implementation, establishing the core framework for all subsequent game systems.
-   **ScriptableObject and DataModel Files Created**: Essential `ScriptableObject` assets and foundational data model C# files have been created. This lays the groundwork for a data-driven design approach within Unity, allowing for flexible and organized management of game data.
-   **UI Manager Created**: `UIManager.cs` has been created to manage UI panel visibility, HUD updates, and basic settings.
-   **Player Character and Interaction Enhanced**: `PlayerCharacter.cs` has been updated for animation state management, and `PlayerInteraction.cs` has been created to handle interaction logic with environmental objects.
-   **Interactable Objects Enhanced**: `Interactable.cs` now supports various interaction types and visual cues.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
-   The project's architectural documentation (`docs/unity_architectural_plan.md`) and technical documentation (`docs/technical.md`) have been updated to thoroughly reflect this full Unity C# rebuild and the exclusive use of native Unity UI, deprecating previous web-based approaches and ReactUnity.
-   The overall task plan (`tasks/tasks_plan.md`) now explicitly outlines the phases and sub-tasks for the Unity rebuild, indicating initial completion of core logic, data model setup, and initial UI/player interaction enhancements.
-   Integration with C# SDKs for cloud services (e.g., Firebase, PlayFab) for robust save features is a key consideration for the new Unity save system.

## Current State (Minigame Systems)
- Scoring and feedback system (ScoringManager) implemented and integrated with minigames and UI.
- Tutorial overlay system (TutorialManager + TutorialOverlay) implemented and integrated with minigames and UI.
- Documentation updated for both systems.

## Current State (PolAI Integration)
- Integration plan and API docs reviewed (`docs/POLAI_API_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/polaiAPIDOCS.md`).
- Task plan updated for phased rollout (album art, text/news, logo, TTS, etc.).

## Next Steps
1.  Continue with the detailed rebuild of game systems within Unity, following the prioritized tasks outlined in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`.
2.  Focus on implementing the remaining Unity UI elements and integrating them with the C# game logic.
3.  Systematically migrate or rebuild remaining game features (e.g., Save System, Audio, Minigames) in C# within the Unity environment.
4.  Regularly review and update all project documentation to maintain alignment with the ongoing Unity development.
5.  Expand feedback system with actionable tips and color cues.
6.  Add example tutorial scripts for minigames.
7.  Continue minigame and UI development as per updated documentation.

## Next Steps (PolAI)
- Implement PolAiService for API calls (image, text, audio).
- Begin with album art generation UI and backend.
- Expand to text/news, logo, TTS, and other features as per plan.

## Legacy Context Note
Sections pertaining to the original web-based implementation (e.g., specific web frontend technologies, previous debugging sessions, and detailed web component descriptions) have been phased out or marked as legacy in the primary documentation files to maintain clarity on the current development direction. This includes elements previously detailed in `src/` directories related to React/TypeScript components and services.

## Recent Changes
- Removed ReactUnity UI files (`RecordingStudioTycoon_UnityPoC/react-ui/src/components/MainMenu.tsx`, `HUD.tsx`, `PauseMenu.tsx`, `GameOver.tsx`, `index.tsx`).
- Created `RecordingStudioTycoon_UnityPoC/Assets/Scripts/UI/UIManager.cs` for native Unity UI management.
- Modified `RecordingStudioTycoon_UnityPoC/Assets/Scripts/GameLogic/GameManager.cs` to expose player XP and Level.
- Enhanced `RecordingStudioTycoon_UnityPoC/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Environment/Interactable.cs` with `InteractionType` enum and flexible `Interact` method.
- Created `RecordingStudioTycoon_UnityPoC/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Player/PlayerInteraction.cs` for centralized player interaction logic.
- Modified `RecordingStudioTycoon_UnityPoC/Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Player/PlayerCharacter.cs` to remove interaction logic, delegating it to `PlayerInteraction.cs`.

## Recent Phase 2 Implementation (16/06/2025)
**Advanced Systems Implementation**:
- **Created `src/types/marketTrends.ts`**: Comprehensive type definitions for market trends system including MarketTrend, SubGenre, MarketAnalysis, and PlayerMarketImpact interfaces.
- **Created `src/services/marketService.ts`**: Market service managing dynamic trends, sub-genre evolution, player impact tracking, and contract value modifiers.
- **Created `src/types/relationships.ts`**: Relationship system types including ReputableEntity, RelationshipManager, ContractHistory, and industry reputation tracking.
- **Created `src/services/relationshipService.ts`**: Comprehensive relationship management service handling client/label interactions, contract generation, and reputation systems.
- **Created `src/types/studioPerks.ts`**: Extensive perk system types including StudioPerk, PerkTree, StudioSpecialization, IndustryPrestige, and milestone systems.
- **Created `src/services/studioUpgradeService.ts`**: Studio upgrade service managing perk trees, specializations, industry prestige, and achievement milestones.
- **Created `src/hooks/useMarketTrends.ts`**: React hook for integrating market trends system with UI components (partially complete, needs TypeScript fixes).
- **Updated documentation**: Updated `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks_plan.md`, and `tasks/active_context.md` to reflect new systems.

- `src/hooks/useGameActions.tsx`: Rewritten to ensure correct imports and `useCallback` usage, and `PerformDailyWorkResult` definition.
- `src/hooks/useStaffManagement.tsx`: Rewritten to ensure correct imports, `SetGameStateFunction` type, and `generateCandidates` import path.
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`: Corrected `MinigameType` import.
- `src/components/MainGameContent.tsx`: Corrected `MinigameType` import and `performDailyWork` prop type.
- `src/components/minigames/MinigameManager.tsx`: Removed problematic imports (`AudioRestorationGame`, `AnalogConsoleGame`) and corresponding `switch` cases, removed duplicate `RhythmTimingGame` import, and other unused imports.
- `src/hooks/useMinigames.ts`: Completed `MINIGAME_REWARDS` object with placeholder reward functions for all `MinigameType` values.
- `src/components/ChartsPanel.tsx`: Removed JSDoc-style comment block causing parsing error.

**Known Issues/Challenges**:
- Persistent "Cannot find module" errors after `write_to_file` operations, suggesting potential caching or file system synchronization issues.
- Inability to run `npm test` due to missing script.
- Discrepancies in file existence (e.g., `AudioRestorationGame.tsx`, `AnalogConsoleGame.tsx`) between `list_files` and `read_file` attempts, indicating active refactoring by other processes.
