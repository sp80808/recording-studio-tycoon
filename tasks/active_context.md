# Current State of Development

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on continuing development according to the established documentation and cleaning up the project by deleting unused files.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The `project/` directory was identified as an unused, separate React application and has been deleted.
- The `docs/ROADMAP copy.md` file was a duplicate and has been deleted.
- Core memory files (`docs/product_requirement_docs.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks_plan.md`, `tasks/active_context.md`) are being created/updated to ensure comprehensive project documentation.

## Recent Changes
- Deleted `project/` directory.
- Deleted `docs/ROADMAP copy.md`.
- Created `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.
- Created `docs/architecture.md`.
- Created `docs/technical.md`.
- Created `tasks/tasks_plan.md`.

## Next Steps
1. Create `tasks/active_context.md` (this file).
2. Ensure all core memory files are present and up-to-date.
3. Continue with development tasks outlined in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`.
4. Regularly review and update documentation as development progresses.
